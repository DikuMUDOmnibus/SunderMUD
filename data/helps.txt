1 SOCIAL SOCIALS~
Socials are a supplement to the chat and role-play aspects of a 
mud, and allow you to do things that are purely for fun, roleplay,
or communication, rather than have any affect on gameplay.
 
Also, sometimes a social will cause a creature to react to you in
strange ways.
 
To view a current list of socials, just type "socials" at your 
command prompt.

101 IMOTD~
{WWelcome Immortal!
ANY unauthorized aiding of a player character through means that would
give that player an advantage another player would not have is {RCHEATING{W
and will be dealt with by deletion of all players involved, AND the 
immortal who was cheating. Do not tempt fate.{w

{YTo the Implementor: Be sure to back up the data directory regularly. 
Losing some of these files could be "problematic" to say the least.
Especially the accounts file.{x
~
101 COMMANDMENTS LAWS 'GOD RULES' GODS~
.
                         ******************************
                         ** The {WRules{x of SunderMud **
                         ******************************

    These are pretty old and standard rules. Abide or die.

1)  Do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals.
    This includes transferring/summoning them to aggressive mobs. 
2)  Do not cheat for ANY mortal in ANY way, especially your own. 
    Unless of course you LIKE deletion. Yes this includes tanking,
    healing/restoring, casting protection spells <armor, sanct>,    
    and softening up or altering mobs.
3)  Do not transfer or summon mobs to mortals or mortals to mobs.
    They have legs, if they want to kill a mob, they can easilly
    go there themselves. 
4)  DO NOT kill the shopkeepers for any reason at ALL. 
5)  DO NOT Copyover or Reboot!!! <-- Plain English for ye. 
6)  Do not give out free equipment.  You don't need to win brownie
    points with the mortals.  Quest are fine but handing out items
    isn't. 
7)  A note on quests: Quests are a good thing, more or less, BUT 
    do not give out overly extravagant prizes.  Exercise some 
    common sense here folks.  Do not load items more than 4 levels
    below their normal level (i.e. no level 5 ogre gauntlets).
8)  Do not undermine the authority of a higher level god.  If you 
    see that someone has been frozen or nochannelled do not restore
    their priveleges.  They are being punished for a reason. Also,
    NEVER argue with an administrator or implementor. If you *are*
    an administrator, NEVER argue with the final decision of the 
    implementor. 
9)  Do not try to overrule each other. If a disagreement between to
    immortals occurs, it should be turned over to a higher level god. 
10) Trusted mortals:  Do not use your god powers to help your mortal
    character.  If you do, your trust will be taken away.
11) If you are a BUILDER, do not give out or use equipment from your 
    area until it has been approved. Also, editing things not your own
    can result in severe punishment.

-1 PUFF~
No plain fanfold paper could hold that fractal Puff --
He grew so fast no plotting pack could shrink him far enough.
Compiles and simulations grew so quickly tame
And swapped out all their data space when Puff pushed his stack frame.
CHORUS:
        Puff the fractal dragon was written in C,
        And frolicked while processes switched in mainframe memory.
        Puff the fractal dragon was written in C,
        And frolicked while processes switched in mainframe memory.
Puff, he grew so quickly, while others moved like snails
And mini-Puffs would perch themselves on his gigantic tail.
All the student hackers loved that fractal Puff
But DCS did not like Puff, and finally said, "Enough!"
                (chorus)
Puff used more resources than DCS could spare.
The operator killed Puff's job -- he didn't seem to care.
A gloom fell on the hackers; it seemed to be the end,
But Puff trapped the exception, and grew from naught again!
                (chorus)
~
-1 RULES~
These are the rules of SunderMud ][.  For other matters, use commom sense.
* Player Killing is {RONLY{w allowed in certain situations, and will not
  be a requirement of participation in this game. Generally, you are safe.

* foul and/or abusive language will not be tolerated on, from anyone
  (including gods). Punishments range from deletion to NOCHANNELing.

* sexual harassment of any form will not be tolerated, punishable by deletion

* If you must mudsex, do so in private. This isn't GodWars.

* no multiple logins, multiple playing, or helping your own characters with
  other characters you own -- by any arrangment.
 
* no kill stealing.  This means you cannot attack a mob someone else is 
  fighting, unless they ask you to. If a mob is injured, and you are not
  the one who injured it, you may not under any circumsances attack it.
  This means NO. Whether it is an easy mob or a hard mob or there is not
  even anybody else logged in! A flag will soon be added to make spotting
  of injured mobs easier.
  
* cheating will not be tolerated.  This includes accepting favors from gods
  and exploiting bugs. If you find a bug, report it, then do not use it.
  {RIf you are unsure of what constitutes a bug, read HELP BUG.{w
~
-1 BUG BUGS~
A bug is anything in the game that the immortals have deemed a mistake in
the code, areas, rules, or layouts. Immortal comment is FINAL on saying
whether or not something is a bug. If an immortal tells you something you
are doing is a bug, you may not argue that it is not. Continuing to exploit
a bug after being warned WILL result in deletion. Just because you are able
to do it does not make it legal.

- The Staff.

~
-1 STORY HISTORY~
{W({GAlso see "help sundermud"{W){w
In the year of Dark Times 73, it came to pass that the old wars were over
before they had barely begun.  Aecindo's followers had completely vanquished
Roqmin's legions from the land, doing what they could to destroy his magical
temple.  The temple remained though, through the years, and so it turns out
did Roqmin's most loyal followers.  Now in the year 500 the gods have
returned to their struggles.  Now they fight to gain control over the lands
which were sundered before this darkened age, the lands which are known
as the Shards of Eskri.  On the final day, it is said, the armies of each
shall meet and combat for those lands.  
 
 
On the night of the Day of Thunder, 17th the Month of Dragon, in the year 500,
a rending tore the skys of the City of Lukhan. The prophets proclaim that 
this was the return of Roqmin to the lands, and cautioned the leaders of
the city to prepare for invasion from that hordes.
It was then that the King sent out a call for all humans to join his army.
Seeing this, and not knowing the reasons, many others took it as a sign of
oncoming war with the humans, who had shunned other races for years, and 
began to raise their own armies. Meanwhile, the true followers of the 
assorted deities (help deity) also began to raise armies.
The prophecies say that when these armies reach mature sizes, the world
shall be changed forever, and peace will be a memory to be cherished, and
then to the children of the future, a memory to never have.
~
0 DELETE~
Use the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name will be
available for use.  This command must be typed twice to delete a character,
and you cannot be forced to delete.  Typing delete with an argument will
return your character to 'safe' status if you change your mind after the
first delete.
~
0 HEALER~
The healer decided to grab a quick buck, and now charges for his heals.  Some
services are still free to players of level 10 or below, however.  To see
a full listing of the healer's services, type 'heal' at his residence. To
receive healing, bring plenty of momey, and type 'heal spell'.
~
-1 GAIN~
Gain is not used in SunderMud.
~
0 SKILLS SPELLS~
Syntax: skills
Syntax: spells
Syntax: skills <class>
Syntax: spells <class>
 
These commands list your character's available skills or spells, with
information on each.
 
If you specify a classname, it will show the skills/spells available
to that class.
~
0 OUTFIT~
The outfit command, usable by levels 5 and below, equips your character with
a new set of sub issue gear (banner, weapon, helmet, shield, and vest), 
courtesy of the Mayor's warehouses.  Only empty equipment slots are affected.

Outfit will charge a cost of 25 gold for each use. If you cannot afford this,
ask an immortal for help. You are not meant to be unable to use outfit,
however this cost has been implemented to prevent abuse.
~
102 XINFO~
The xinfo command toggles an immortal's extra information display.  Only
has limited use currently, affects extra autoexit information display.
~
0 CONFIG AUTO AUTOLIST AUTOLOOT AUTOGOLD AUTOSAC AUTOEXIT AUTOASSIST AUTOSPLIT~
Sunder uses varies automatic actions, to ease the boredom of always splitting
gold and sacrificing corpses.  

In fact, there got to be so many of them that they are now listed on the
config command, which is where you change them. A brief description of some
(but not all) of them follows:

autoassist: automatically help group members in combat
autolist  : list all automatic actions
autoloot  : take all equipment from dead mobiles
autogold  : take all gold from dead mobiles
autosac   : sacrifice dead monsters (if autoloot is on, only empty corpes)
autoexit  : display full exit descriptions
autosplit : split up spoils from combat among your group members
autosave  : toggles notification of mud's autosave
prompt    : toggles display of prompt (see help prompt)
noloot    : toggles if your corpse can be looted
nosummon  : toggles if you are summonable
nofollow  : toggles if you accept followers

~
-1 COUNT~
The count command displays the number of people (that you can see) logged
into the mud.  It also displays the highest number observed since the last
reboot, if it is higher.

-1 CHANGES~
SunderMud has undergone MANY changes over its history. To see a view
of most of these changes (many have been done and forgotten to be noted
about, sorry!) you can view them by year. Please refer to the following
helpfiles:

{GChanges1996
{WChanges1997

~
-1 GATE~
The gate spell is a powerful transportation magic that opens up a portal
between your character and another person or creature somewhere else in the
world.  This portal will transport you and any pet you might have, but not
other members of your group.  Monsters recieve a save against gate, and
monster or players more than 3 levels higher than you can not be gated to at
all.  God rooms, private rooms, and no recall rooms cannot be gated to, and
no recall rooms cannot be gated out of.  Finally, any god or hero is also
immune to gate, as well as is player who has nosummon set.
~
-1 PROMPT~
syntax: prompt
syntax: prompt <string>

The prompt command with no string argument will toggle your prompt on or off.
Any additional characters following the prompt command are treated as
a string argument to be interpreted as the new prompt. 

The following variable replacement values are currently supported.
$h current hp           $H maximum hp
$m current mana         $M maximum mana
$v current movement     $V maximum movement
$e total xp             $E xp to next level
$g total gold           $w current wait states
$l current level        $N Name of the current area
$o Encumbrance total
$S The "$" Symbol

Typing 'prompt default' will set your prompt back to the default, as shown
above. To include colour or other formatting, view 'help colour'.

Any characters that do not match a replacement value are printed directly.
ie, the command "prompt hello <%hhp %mm %vmv>" would generate a prompt like:
hello <50hp 200m 200mv>
~
-1 'CUSTOM SCORE'~
Custom Score commands are available on SunderMud. You may create your own,
or select a pre-made Custom Score. The following commands are available to
use and configure your Custom Score.

cscore        - Views your custom score
csedit        - Edit your custom score
cslist        - List pre-made custom scores
cselect <num> - Selects a pre-made custom score

All colour codes may be used in your custom score, as well as special codes
which operate similarly to the way custom prompts work.

See Also: {Gscorecodes{w for information about valid codes.
~
-1 'CODES'~
Entering these codes in a string of text in your custom score will cause
the code to be replaced with the data specified in the description.

See Also: {GColour{w (for colour/format codes)
See Also: {GCode Usage{w (for how to use codes)

Note that some of these codes are also available in prompts (See help prompt
for information on which ones), but not all. They are listed here in alpha-
betical order, and are case sensitive. Codes using # are listed first,
followed by those that use @.

Codes that use #:

-1 'RACE HELP' 'RACE' 'RACES'~
SunderMud ][ has the following races for player characters:
 
+----------------------------------------------+
| Race     | Base XP  | Lifespan   | Start Age |
|          |Mort/ Demi|            |           |
+----------+----------+------------+-----------+
| Human    |1200 8000 | 75 Years   | 17        |
| Dwarf    |2700 8375 | 95 Years   | 20        |
| Elf      |4700 8875 | 250 Years  | 50        |
| Giant    |2000 8200 | 65 Years   | 15        |
| Gargoyle |4300 8775 | 200 Years  | 60        |
| Kobold   |1300 8025 | 50 Years   | 9         |
| Centaur  |2700 8375 | 60 Years   | 11        |
| Azer     |3100 8475 | 90 Years   | 22        |
| Kender   |2400 8300 | 75 Years   | 15        |
+----------------------------------------------+
 
As can be seen in the chart, Mortals have a much lower base XP requirement
than Demi-Gods. This is due to their finite adventuring careers. A Demi-God
takes many more years to build his or her strength, but ultimately *is* 
more powerful.
 
There are no experience penalties based on class chosen for each race,
however, they each have strengths and weaknesses (which are also reflected
in the experience cost), as well as excelling in differing abilities. To
see specific information on each race, use the help command with that
race's name, ie, 'help dwarf' for information on playing a Dwarf.
~
-1 GARGOYLE GARGOYLES~
Despite rumours of being demon spawn, gargoyles are actually the holy
protectors of the realm.  The gods have given them the duty of defending the
weak and helpless, especially against the evils that wander the cities and
villages of the realm.  With their powerful wings that grant them flight and
their innate ability to detect evil, gargoyles become a powerful force
against the horrid evils in the world.  Gargoyles find meditation natural
and excell at the clerical arts.  Being of divine purpose, gargoyles are
resistant against holy attacks, but are vulnerable to weapons of silver.

~
-1 CENTAUR CENTAURS~
Centaurs are a creature with the lower body of a horse and the upper
body of a human.  They have great speed and strength, thus they
are powerful warriors.  Their size makes them resistant to
bashing weapons; however, being rather weak minded, they are
vulnerable to mental attacks.

~
-1 AZER AZERS~
The Azer are a humanoid race originally from the elemental plane of
fire.  They resemble the stocky dwarves in many ways, but their skin
is a metallic bronze color, and their hair seems to be made of flame.
A large group of their kind were enslaved on the material 
plane eons ago by a powerful mage who was eventually killed in
a fantastic sorcery duel with an arch-demon.  The freed Azer had
spent so much time on the material plane that they could not return
home, as their tolerance for the extreme temperature of the plane
of fire had diminished greatly.  Azer still prefer the hottest
regions of the material plane and are still vulnerable to cold
based attacks.  Although no longer immune to fire attacks, they
are still quite resistant to heat, and a few actually still enjoy an 
occasional dip in a cooling lava pool.  The Azer have somehow
retained their mystical fiery aura, which seems to flow and weave
as if alive whenever an Azer is forced to fight.  This aura strikes
out at the nearest enemy in combat, thus giving Azer a unique 
special attack.  Azer make good fighters and mages, and their 
extra planar nature has granted them the meditation and fast
healing skills for free.

~
-1 DWARF DWARVES~
Dwarves are short, stocky demi-humans, known for foul temper and great
stamina.  Dwarves have high strength and constitution, but poor dexterity. 
They are not as smart as humans, but are usually wiser due to their long
lifespans.  Dwarves make excellent fighters and priests, but are very poor
mages or thieves.

~
-1 ELF ELVES~
Elves are slightly taller than humans, but have a much lighter build.  They
lack the strength and stamina of the other races, but are for more agile,
both in body and mind.  Elves are superb mages and thieves, but have at
best fair talent as warriors or priests.

Elves are burned by the touch of iron, and while they can use these weapons,
they prefer not to do so in their careers.

~
-1 HUMAN HUMANS MAN~
Humans are by far the most common race in Cwertin, and are considered the
standard by which other races are judged. Their abilities are average, and
they excell at almost any task they set their minds to.
 
Humans are typically neutral in political matters, though this may vary 
when dealing with particularly evil races. The human hometown is Lukhan, the
center of most trade in Cwertin.

MAX:    20  20  20  20  20
~
-1 GIANT GIANTS~
Giants are the largest of the races, ranging from 9-12 feet in height.  They
are stronger than any other race, and almost as durable as the dwarves.  
They aren't too bright, however, and their huge size makes them more clumsy
than the other races.  Giants make the best warriors of any race, but are
ill-suited for any other profession.

Giants resist heat and cold with nary a mark, due to their huge mass.  However,
their slow minds make them extremely vulnerable to mental attacks.  Giants,
due to their size and stamina, receive the fast healing and bash skills for
free.

BASE:   +3  -2   0  -2 +1
MAX:    22  15  18  15  20
 
~
-1 WANDS STAVES SCROLLS~
Magical items require training to use properly.  If your character lacks the
necessary skill to use an item, he will fail, possibly destroying it.  The
item skills are as follows:

scrolls	The reading of magical scrolls and books (see 'help recite')
staves	The use of staves and similar devices (see 'help brandish')
wands		The use of wands and similar items (see 'help zap') 
~
-1 MAGE 'MAGIC-USER' MAG~
Traditional mages specialize in the casting of spells, often of offensive
natures. They spend many hours studying and perfecting their magics, so they
are all very reliable spells, and usually quite potent. They tend to stay far
away from those spells which are found to be unreliable.
~
-1 AVENGER AVE~
Avengers are those who have dedicated their lives to the god Aecindo. His
followers are very defensively oriented, moreso than any other class. Most
of their abilities focus on healing or defending the innocent. They do,
however, have some combat ability since there are many who would see their 
order disbanded.
~
-1 DEFILER~
Defilers are the priests of chaos and evil. They may be found serving either of
the deities Roqmin or Thuahamin, but in either case they are the anti-thesis
to everything that Avengers strive for. They derive dark magics from their
deities, with the power over life and death.
~
-1 THIEF~
Thieves are a marginal class. They do few things better than any other class,
but they can profit the most from the things they do know how to do. Thieves 
are specialists at thievery and covert actions, being capable of entering
areas undetected where more powerful adventurers would fear to tread.
They are better fighters than clerics, but lack the wide weapon selection
of warriors.
~
-1 WARRIOR~
Warriors live for combat and the thrill of battle. They are the best fighters
of all the classes, but lack the subtle skills of thieves and the magical
talents of mages and priests.  Warriors are best for those who don't mind
taking the direct approach, even when another method might be called for.
The Warrior is the most powerful class physically, but they don't know
much besides fighting.
~
-1 MONK~
The warrior-monk, the only type of Monk playable here, devotes his life to
the study of martial arts. Unlike the common warrior, he views his body as 
a temple and the ultimate tool of his art. He does not make use of weaponry,
nor does he use a shield. His keen senses give him the strength to fight as
a living weapon.
~
-1 EXOTIC WEAPONS WEAPON AXE DAGGER FLAIL MACE POLEARM SPEAR SWORD WHIP~
Each weapon skill applies to a specific group of armaments, and determines
how well a character fights with a particular weapon.  If the character
has the parry skill as well, he can parry incoming attacks.  The chance of
parrying is best if the character in question is skilled at both his
weapon and his opponent's. 

The weapon skills consist of the following:

axe		the use of axes, ranging from hand to great (but not halberds)
dagger	the use of knives and daggers, and other stabbing weapons
flail		skill in ball-and-chain type weapons
mace		this skill includes clubs and hammers as well as maces
polearm	the use of pole weapons (except spears), including halberds
spear		this skill covers both spears and staves, but not polearms
sword		the warrior's standby, from rapier to claymore
whip		the use of whips, chains, and bullwhips
exotic	the use of strange magical weapons
		
The exotic skill cannot be purchased, and is dependent solely upon level.
~
-1 'SHIELD BLOCK'~
Shield block is a rather fancy name for the art of parrying with a shield.
Characters with no shield block skill will not be able to defend themselves
well with a shield.  All classes may learn shield block, but only warriors and
clerics are good at it.  Beware, flails ignore shield blocking attempts, and
whips have an easier time getting around them.  Axes may split shields in two.
~
-1 BRAND~
<enchantment group>
syntax: cast brand <weapon>

The brand spell gives a magic user the chance to put a random elemental
brand (Flame, Frost, Acid, Lightning) upon a weapon.  There is a risk
that the weapon will be destroyed, but if branded successfully, the
brand is permanent.  Branding only works on weapons without a current
brand flag.  High level gods have the ability to create weapons with
multiple branding flags...however, such weapons are *never* for use
by mortals..... 
~
-1 MINOR CREATION~
syntax: cast 'minor creation' <object>

Object can currently be: "boat" or "bag" to create these items.

More will be added later, as demand and whim warrants.
~
-1 WEATHER~
Shows local weather conditions.
 
Since the magics which caused the sundering are still raging rampantly, the
weather conditions in the world are often unpredictable, and subject to the
whims of local wizards.
~
-1 BACKSTAB~
Backstab is the favored attack of  thieves, murderers, and other rogues.  It 
can be used with any weapon type, but is most effective with piercing weapons.
The damage inflicted by a backstab is determined by the attacker's level, his
weapon skill, his backstab skill, and the power of his opponent.
Only thieves may learn backstab.
~
-1 CIRCLE~
Circle is a skill learned by advanced thieves, murderers, and other rogues. It
can be used with any weapon type, but is most effective with piercing weapons.
This skill allows the practicer to slip out of sight of his opponent briefly,
and launch a surprise attack upon him from behind. Needless to say this is very
difficult to accomplish, and thus it only thieves ever learn this skill.  

Circle only works when the victim is either blind or is not focusing 
directly on you in combat.  Fighting in a group is an excellent way
to get circle attacks to work effectively.
~
-1 BASH~
The bash skill is a warrior talent, a brute-force attack designed to knock
your foe to his knees.  Its success depends on many factors, including the
bash rating, your weight, and the size of your opponent.  Bashing a dragon
is not generally a wise idea.
~
-1 BERSERK~
Only powerful warriors can master berserking, the ability to enter insane rage
in combat.  Its effects are not altogether unlike the frenzy spell -- a huge
surge of combat prowess, coupled with a disregard for personal safety.  
Berserking warriors are more resistant to the effects of magic.
~
-1 DIRT 'DIRT KICKING'~
Consider by some to be a cowardly skill, dirt kicking gives the clever 
combatant a chance to blind his opponent by casting dirt into his eyes.  The
blindness does not last long, but can provide an edge in combat.  Dexterity
helps in hitting or avoiding a dirt kick.  Only warriors and thieves may
learn this skill.
~
-1 DISARM~
Disarm is a somewhat showy and unreliable skill, designed to relieve your
opponent of his weapon.  The best possible chance of disarming occurs when you
are skilled both your own and your opponent's weapon. Only talented thieves
and warriors may learn this skill.
~
-1 DODGE~
In the words of one wise warrior, 'the best way to block a blow is to not
be where it lands'.  The dodge skill honors this tradition, by improving the
character's natural agility to the point where many blows will miss the 
target. The chance of dodging is also affected by the dexterity of the
attacker and the target.  Any class may learn dodging.
~
-1 'ENHANCED DAMAGE'~
Warriors and skilled thieves can become skilled enough in combat that they are
able to inflict more damage than other classes.  Enhanced damage is checked
for with each hit, although with a low skill, the chance of receiving a bonus
is very low indeed.
~
-1 'ULTRA DAMAGE'~
Warriors eventually learn *exactly* where to hit their enemies to inflict
the most damage. Thieves never gain this ability. Ultra damage is checked for 
with each hit, after and cumulative with enhanced damage (though you can have 
ultra damage without enhanced damage). The bonus for Ultra Damage is larger
than the one for enhanced damage.
~
-1 'ENVENOM'~
Thieves can learn the art of poisons very well, and thus are the only class 
able to gain the envenom skill. Envenom will imbue a weapon with a poison 
coating which is quite durable (but will eventually wear off) or can even 
add poison to food or drink.
~
-1 'HAND TO HAND'~
Hand to Hand combat is the ability to fight effectively using ones bare
hands. More than mere fist-fighting, the master of this type of combat
will often be the better of his armed opponent. The amount of physical
strength and dedication required to practise this skill leaves it solely
in the hands of warriors and monks. It is said that a good monk using this
skill can tear an opponent apart as if he were wielding a weapon.
~
-1 KICK~
Kicking allows the adventurer to receive an extra attack in combat, a powerful
kick. However, a failed kick may throw the unwary off balance.
~
-1 PARRY~
If at first you fail to dodge, block it.  Parry is useful for deflecting 
attacks, and is successful more often than dodge.  Parry requires a weapon for
full success, the hand-to-hand skill may also be used, but results in reduced
damage instead of no damage.  The best chance of parrying occurs when the
defender is skilled in both his and his opponent's weapon type.
~
-1 RESCUE~
A friend in need is a friend indeed.  And when in combat, a warrior with
the rescue skill is just the friend you need.  Rescue allows you to intercede
in combat, protecting weaker characters from bodily harm. Hopefully the
favor will be returned.  Success in rescuing depends on the skill rating, as
well as a comparison of level, dexterity, and speed between the character and
the target. (note: you rescue a friend, not the monster)
~
-1 ROTATE~
Syntax:  rotate <victim>
The rotate skill allows a character to change his focus of attack from one
creature to another.  The victim *must* already be fighting you in
order to change your focus to him/her.  The ability to reposition yourself
this way in a fight is based on several factors.  Your dexterity, your
level in relation to the mob you're trying to stop focusing on, and your
skill % for rotate all play a big part in determining whether you
can successfully rotate to another mob. 
~
-1 TRIP~
Trip is a somewhat dastardly attack, and involves using any one of a
number of methods to bring your opponent down to the ground.  Tripping
large monsters is generally not a good idea, and agile ones will find the
attack easy to avoid.
~
-1 'SECOND ATTACK'~
Training in second attack allows the character a chance at additional strikes
in combat -- allow a 100% second attack does NOT guarantee 2 attacks every
round.  
~
-1 'THIRD ATTACK'~
Training in third attack allows the character a chance at an additional strike
in a combat, and increases the chance of a second attack as well.  Perfect
third attack does NOT assure three attacks per round.  
~
-1 HIDE SNEAK~
Hide and sneak are similar skills, both related to remaining undetected.
Hide has a very high chance of success, but only works for as long as the
character remains stationary.  Sneak may be used when moving (including to
sneak by monsters), but has a lower chance of success.  
~
-1 'FAST HEALING'~
The fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, whether walking, resting,
or sleeping. It represents knowledge of healing herbs or just general 
toughness and stamina.  Fast healing is checked every tick, and it is 
possible for it to fail.  
~
-1 SPEAK LANGUAGE LANGUAGES~
Syntax:  speake <language>

Languages are available by race...ie, each race has an associated language.
There is also common tongue that everyone can speak and understand.  To 
change the language you are speaking, type "language azer" for example.
Some channels use languages, others don't.  You will see which use
languages when you send a message, if you see something like:
"You say in azer tongue ' message '" when you send a message, you have
spoken it in a specific language.

~
-1 LORE~
syntax:     lore <object>
 
Lore is the ability to research items and find out what they do. It takes
100 moves to lore an item, because you must travel to find someone who
knows about the item.
~
-1 PEEK~
The peek skill is useful for seeing what a player or monster is carrying,
the better to use the steal command with.  More intelligent characters are
harder to peek at.  
~
-1 PICK 'PICK LOCK'~
Lock picking is one of the prime skills of thieves, allowing them to gain
access to many secured areas.  Lock picking chances are improved by  
intelligence, and hindered by the difficulty of the lock. 
~
-1 MEDITATION~
This skill is similar to fast healing, but relies on the concentration and
mantras to increase mana recovery when the character is sleeping or resting.
~
-1 STEAL~
Theft is the defining skill of the thief, and is only available to that class.
It allows items to be stolen from the inventory of monsters and characters,
and even from shops!  But beware, shop keepers guard their merchandise 
carefully!
~
-1 SHARPEN~
syntax: sharpen <weapon>

The sharpen skill allows an experienced warrior the chance to improve his
weapon by sharpening its blade.  Success is based upon the warriors
level, sharpen skill %, dexterity, and strength.  Failure may result
in no change in the weapon, or the weapon may be dulled beyond repair.
If successful, the weapon is given the "sharp" flag, and in extremely
*rare* instances, a warrior may create a "vorpal" weapon. 
~
-1 DUAL~
syntax: dual <weapon>

The dual wield skill allows a warrior to use two weapons instead of the
standard weapon/shield combo.  Standard rules regarding two-handed weapons
still apply, ie, medium sized creatures need both hands for one weapon, thus
cannot use a shield or dual wield another weapon.  Your dual wield %
affects your hit and damage rolls with your second weapon, so although
you can wield a second weapon with the skill at 1%, you will not hit
often, nor will you do any significant damage.

102 RESET RESETS ~
Syntax: 
RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> <location on body> [<max #>]   - equips last mobile
RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> inside <obj vnum>  [<max #>]   - store in container
RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> room               [<max #>]   - store in room
RESET <number> MOB <vnum>                    [<max #>]   - load a mobile
RESET <number> DELETE                           - delete a reset
 
RESET alone will display the resets in the current room.  The <number> will
be displayed with this list.  Typing ? WEAR-LOC will list possible locations
that an object can be loaded to.  The [<max #>] is the maximum number of
mobiles allowed in this room and will default to 1 if no number is entered.
For resets to be successful make sure that you add them in a logical order.
For example, if you are equipping a mobile, don't load a container in the
room and fill it with some objects and then continue equipping the mobile.
It is likely that resets will backfire if they are not carefully entered.
If you wish to reset the room then use EDIT ROOM RESET.
{RIf reset fails to work, try {YMRESET{R or {YORESET{R. 
 
{WNOTE{x: the <number> field is *NOT* the number of mobs/objects
the reset will make. the <number> field specifies where in the list 
of resets the new reset will appear.
This is {WVERY{x powerful. if you have 4 resets, and specify a <number>
of 1, the new reset will insert itself before
ALL of your other resets. This might not be your intended result. If
you want the reset to be last on the list, be sure to specify a number
that is higher than the other resets in the room. If, though, you need
to add an object to a mob that is reset first, and there are other mobs
after it, then you would specify a number that would insert itself after
the mob you want the reset to follow.

As a final note, if your reset is "flaky", you may need to wait for a
reboot. Resets tend to be that way.. Perhaps I'll figure out why someday.

~
0 DAMAGE~
When one character attacks another, the severity of the damage is shown in the
verb used in the damage message. Usually, the more impressive a damage message
is, the more damage that was done. There is no listing, hopefully you can
discover them all yourself :)
 
~
0 DEATH~
Depending on the way the Mud is currently configured, death includes different
things for your character, and the current configuration is reported to you
during the logon sequence (You did bother to read all of that didn't you?)

Normally, when your character dies, you find yourself back at your hometown's
healer.  Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,
together with all of your equipment.  Your gold stays with you. The only time
this is not so, is if the mud is configured for full permadeath, in which case
your character will cease to be (SunderMud is not normally configured this
way).

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.
Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  Under level 25, you lose half-way 
back to the beginning of your level, thus dieing over and over won't hurt 
too much. After level 25, though you lose 500 xp per death. If this takes 
you to a lower xp level, then you lose that level.

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).
Only the player who died, or someone in the same group, can retrieve objects
from a player's corpse.

If the mud is configured for AGING (also reported during logon) your character
may eventually die of old age. The age at which this happens varies greatly
depending upon your race. If Partial Aging is in force, your chracter will
re-appear as described above, and it is little more than an annoyance.
However, if full aging is enabled, that is not the case. If you have any
questions about which level of death is enabled on the Mud, ask an immortal.

~
0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP LEVELS~
On this mud, there are 100 mortal levels. While many muds offer more,
we feel that this amount helps maintain game balance much more effectively.
Don't worry - You won't run out of levels very soon, it takes some time to
gain in levels. Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  
The number of experience points you need will vary based on which class
you have chosen as well as your race.

You gain experience by:

    being part of a group that kills a monster
    stealing successfully
    advancing in a skill (without using practices)
    being seen role-playing well by an imm

You lose experience by:

    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of certain spells
    dying

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your alignment
versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed
lately; and some random variation.
~
0 PET PETS~
You can buy pets in the pet shop.  You may own only one pet at a time, after 
the old one dies you may purchase a replacement.

~
0 TICK~
TICKs as known in most Diku/Merc/ROM mud have little to no meaning here. Your
character regenerates status semi-continuously (actually about every 3 seconds)
so the need to "count ticks" is unimportant. MOBs reset on a tick-timer system
as in the past, but you'll find timing them without any way to tell when this
happens to be more difficult.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if someone is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.
~
0 !~
Syntax: !

! repeats the last command you typed.
~
0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~
Syntax: north
Syntax: south
Syntax: east
Syntax: west
Syntax: up
Syntax: down

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.
~
0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.
~
0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.

Some exits are actually hidden, however, and you will need to actively {Wsearch{w 
the room to find them. Obviously, you should see the {Wsearch{w command for this 
(we do try to be rather simple).
 
See Also: {GAutoexit{w, {GBrief{w.
~
0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~
Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <amount> coins
Syntax: get  <object>
Syntax: get  <object> <container>
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> coins <character>
Syntax: put  <object> <container>

DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

DROP, GET and PUT understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and
'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.
~
0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~
Syntax: equipment
Syntax: inventory

EQUIPMENT (often abbreviated eq) lists what you are currently 
wearing on your person and using, such as armor and weapons.
If the item is worn in a position that offers armor protection,
then it will also list the amount of protection it offers you
versus the four basic damage types.
 
INVENTORY lists those items that you happen to be carrying but
are not currently using (often abbreviated i).
 
If you have invisible items, or are blind, you may not see
everything you are carrying.
~
0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object>
 
COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.
 
COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.
 
COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects, and the objects
must be of the same type.
~
0 FLEE~
Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

{RWarning: All commands you have sent to the mud will be executed
{GBEFORE{R a flee is attempted. This includes auto-flee!{x

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.
~
0 EXAMINE LOOK~
Syntax: look
Syntax: look    <object>
Syntax: look    <character>
Syntax: look    <direction>
Syntax: look    <keyword>
Syntax: look in <container>
Syntax: look in <corpse>
Syntax: examine <container>
Syntax: examine <corpse>

LOOK looks at something and sees what you can see.

EXAMINE is short for 'LOOK container' followed by 'LOOK IN container'.
~
0 SCAN~
syntax: scan

The scan command looks in all directions and reports mobs and players
that can be seen in a one room radius around you. 
~
0 ORDER~
Syntax: order <character> command
Syntax: order all command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggressive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.
~
0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
(also Syntax: cast sleep)
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.

Some magic-users have the ability to cast sleep upon a victim with
a spell. This spell cannot be awakened from naturally.
~
0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to any visible player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.
 
See {Whelp afk{w for a way to display tells you missed due to being away
from your keyboard.
~
0 AUCTION CHAT . SHOUT YELL MUSIC~
Syntax: auction <message>
Syntax: chat    <message>
Syntax: shout   <message>
Syntax: yell    <message>

SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world.  To curb excessive
shouting, SHOUT imposes a three-second delay on the shouter.

AUCTION and CHAT are variants of SHOUT (without the delay).  '.' is a synonym
for CHAT.

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.

Type a channel name by itself to turn it off.
~
0 EMOTE~
Syntax: emote <action>
 
Emotes are a simple way of declaring character action. You simply type emote,
followed by the ext you want others to see as your action.
~
0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~
Syntax: hold   <object>
Syntax: remove <object>
Syntax: wear   <object>
Syntax: wear   all
Syntax: wield  <object>

Three of these commands will take an object from your inventory and start using
it as equipment.  HOLD is for light sources, wands, and staves.  WEAR is for
armor.  WIELD is for weapons.

WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD each suitable item in your
inventory.

You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
to use it properly.

REMOVE will take any object from your equipment and put it back into your
inventory.
~
0 BUG TYPO~
Syntax: bug <message>
Syntax: typo <message>

These commands will take your message and record it into a file as feedback
to the mud implementors.
~
0 CREDITS~
Syntax: credits

This command shows the list of the original Diku Mud implementors.
To see credits for SunderMud 1, type "HELP SUNDERMUD".
 
For Rom 2.3 (*NOT* 2.4) credits, see "help rom"
~
0 COMMANDS COMMANDLIST~
Syntax: commands <option>
 
<option> can be an Index Number, or a Search Key.
 
If you enter a {Wsearch key{w, then all the commands which match that
key will be listed (by searching the command name and the description).
 
If you enter an {Windex number{w, you'll be given a list of all the 
commands in that index category. To get an up to date list of {Windex
numbers{w, enter the {Gcommands{w command with no options.
 
The output of the commands function will include a {Wbrief description{w
of what each matching command does.

~
0 WHO~
Syntax: who

WHO shows the people currently in the game.  Some people may choose to
remain unseen and won't appear on the WHO (Usually these will either be
immortals are magicians who can become invisible)
 
WHO without any arguments shows all of the (visible) people currently playing.

With arguments, WHO can show players of certain races or levels.
For example:
 
who 10          lists all players of level 10 or above
who 15 20       lists all players between level 15 and 20
who elf         lists all clerics playing
who immortal    lists all immortals playing
who helper      lists all helpers playing
who clan        lists members of your clan playing

Races may be abbreviated.
~
0 WHERE~
Syntax: where
Syntax: where

'where' Tells you what area of the mud you are in.

~
0 HELP~
Syntax: help
Syntax: help <keyword>

HELP without any arguments shows a one-page command summary.

HELP <keyword> shows a page of help on that keyword.  The keywords include
all the commands, spells, and skills listed in the game. Obviously you
should have already figured this out though, if you are reading this.

HLIST shows a list of all available help topics.
~
0 DESCRIPTION DESC~
Syntax: description <string>
Syntax: description edit
Syntax: description + <string>

Using the edit parameter, you will be taken into the string editor
to enter your character description, or:
Sets your long description to the given string.  If the description string
starts with a '+', the part after the '+' is appended to your current
description, so that you can make multi-line descriptions.
~
0 PASSWORD~
Syntax: password <old-password> <new-password>

PASSWORD changes your character's password.  The first argument must be
your old password.  The second argument is your new password.

The PASSWORD command is protected against being snooped or logged.
~
0 TITLE~
Syntax: title <string>

Sets your title to a given string.

The game supplies a title when your character is created and when you
advance a level.  You can use TITLE to set your title to something else.
~
0 WIMPY~
Syntax: wimpy
Syntax: wimpy <number>

WIMPY sets your wimpy value.  When your character takes damage that reduces
your hit points below your wimpy value, you will automatically attempt to flee.
You will only flee if your character is not in a wait state -- i.e. has not
been using combat commands like cast, trip and bash, and has not been
tripped or bash by an enemy.

WIMPY with no argument sets your wimpy value to 20% of your maximum hit points.

Some monsters are wimpy.
~
0 OPEN CLOSE LOCK UNLOCK PICK~
Syntax: open   <object|direction>
Syntax: close  <object|direction>
Syntax: lock   <object|direction>
Syntax: unlock <object|direction>
Syntax: pick   <object|direction>

OPEN and CLOSE open and close an object or a door.

LOCK and UNLOCK lock and unlock a closed object or door.  You must have
the requisite key to LOCK or UNLOCK.

PICK can open a lock without having the key.  In order to PICK successfully,
you must practice the appropriate skill.
~
0 DRINK EAT FILL~
Syntax: drink <object>
Syntax: eat   <object>
Syntax: fill  <object>

When you are thirsty, DRINK something.

When you are hungry, EAT something.

FILL fills a drink container with water.
~
0 SHOP SHOPS BUY LIST SELL VALUE~
Syntax: buy   <object>
Syntax: list
Syntax: sell  <object>
Syntax: value <object>

BUY buys an object from a shop keeper.
When multiple items of the same name are listed, type 'buy n.item', where n
is the position of the item in a list of that name.  So if there are two
swords, buy 2.sword will buy the second. You do not need to do this if the
multiples are all of the same type.

LIST lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you and how many he has.
List <name> shows you only objects of that name.

SELL sells an object to a shop keeper. The more of an item the shopkeeper 
already has, the less he will pay for new items of that same type.

VALUE asks the shop keeper how much he, she, or it will buy the item for.
 
If an object has {R--{x under the Qty field, there is an infinite supply
of this item. If there is a number under the Qty field, then only that many
exist in the shop.
 
Additionally, if the object has any wear on it, it will be commented to
the right of the list. If there is no condition listed, the object is at
100% condition, or perfect.
 
Finally, if you want to buy multiples of the same item all at once, use the
* option. Thus, to buy 10 bread, type :
{w   buy 10*bread
~
0 RESIZE REPAIR~
Syntax: resize <object> 
Syntax: resize <object> cost
Syntax: repair <object> 
Syntax: repair <object> cost

{RNOTE: Size Code Is Not Enabled, Ignore It.{x
Resizing and repairing of objects can be done by any shopkeeper who 
normally would buy such objects from you.  The greater the size 
difference between the object and you, the higher the cost of resizing.
Repairing costs are based on how badly damaged an item is.  Using
the "cost" option with either command simply asks the shopkeeper for
the servicing cost without actually performing any action on the object.
Additionally, objects of different material types will cost different 
amounts of gold to repair, due to difficulty in working with, or 
availability of certain materials. Unique materials cannot be repaired,
as they are either not understood or unavailable.
~
0 SACRIFICE~
Syntax: sacrifice <object>

SACRIFICE offers an object to your Zeran, who may reward you.
Not everything gives gold anymore.
~
0 SCROLL~
Syntax: scroll
Syntax: scroll <number>

This command changes the number of lines the mud sends you in a page (the 
default is 22 lines).  Change this to a higher number for larger screen
sizes, or to 0 to disabling paging.
~
0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~
Syntax: brandish
Syntax: quaff    <potion>
Syntax: recite   <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap      <target>
Syntax: zap

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.

These commands may require an item skill to be successful, see the help entries
on the skills scrolls, staves, and wands for more information.
~
0 CONSIDER~
Syntax: consider <character>

CONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing a character.
Of course, it's only a rough estimate.
 
It also gives you an estimate of the mob's relative health to you.
~
0 FOLLOW GROUP~
Syntax: follow <character>
Syntax: group
Syntax: group <character>

FOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,
just FOLLOW <yourself>.

GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.

You may FOLLOW and GROUP only with characters who are within five levels of
your own. There is also a limit of a maximum 10 characters/mobs per group.
~
0 VISIBLE~
VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
making you visible again.
~
0 QUIT RENT SAVE~
Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: RENT ... not!
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and object.  The game saves your character every
15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving.  Typing save
will block all other command for about 20 seconds, so use it sparingly.
(90+ players all typing save every 30 seconds just generated too much lag)

Some objects, such as keys and potions, may not be saved.

QUIT leaves the game. You may QUIT anywhere, without penalty. Muds which do
not allow you to QUIT, in this immortal's opinion, have their heads up their
umm nevermind. When you return, you will be in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.
~
0 RECALL /~
Syntax: RECALL

RECALL prays to your god for miraculous transportation from where you are
back to the Temple of Midgaard.  '/' is a synonym for RECALL.

If you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for fleeing),
and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for fleeing).  This
chance is based on your recall skill, although a 100% recall does not 
insure success.

RECALL costs half of your movement points.

RECALL doesn't work in certain god-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a
curse may not recall at all.
 
Demi-Gods have more to lose by recalling from combat because of damage to
their reputation, and the fact that the risk of staying is less to them.
~
0 SPLIT~
Syntax: SPLIT <amount>

SPLIT splits some gold between you and all the members of your
group who are in the same room as you.  It's customary to SPLIT
the gold after a kill.
~
0 STEAL~
Syntax: STEAL coins <character>
Syntax: STEAL <object> <character>

STEAL attempts to steal coins, or an object, from a character.  Success
is based on many factors, including steal skill %, dexterity, visibility,
etc.  Players may steal from any level mob, but may only steal from other
players if they are in a PKILL room (help PKILL).  Regardless of whether
you manage to steal the item you want, checks are made to see if anyone
else in the room has noticed anything suspicious.  A crafty thief will
not stick around after an attempt at stealing, as he may have been
noticed...... 
~
0 PRAC PRACTICE~
Syntax: PRACTICE
Syntax: PRACTICE <skill|spell>

PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all
the skills and spells available to you.  You can check this anywhere.

PRACTICE with an argument practice that skill or spell.  Your learning
percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to a some maximum which is determined
depending on your class.  You must be at a guild master to practice.

The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session.  The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will
have each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you
do use them.
 
Skills over level 50 are more specialised, and therefore require
the services of a learned adept at that skill. These skills therefore
can only be learned from certain mobs, and it is your job to find these
to gain those higher level skills.
 
See {Whelp skillmaster{w for more information on those types of
skills and spells.
~
110 ADVANCE~
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~
110 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~
108 ALLOW BAN~
Syntax: allow   <site>
	ban     <site>
	ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list.

The site ban test works by suffix comparison, so if you ban 'foo.edu',
all sites within 'foo.edu' are banned as well.

Site bans are not saved; every time the server is rebooted, the site
ban list is cleared.  
~
109 REBOOT SHUTDOWN~
Syntax: reboot
	shutdown

Reboot shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of fifteen seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

Shutdown shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.

Never, ever, shutdown the mud without permission from Lotherius.
~
106 WIZLOCK NEWLOCK~
Syntax: wizlock
	newlock

Wizlock and newlock both block login attempts to the mud.  Wizlock locks
out all non-gods (i.e. level less than 101), except for link-dead players who
are returning.  Newlock only locks out new character generation, typically
used for preventing a spammer from returning.  Wizlocking should be avoided,
and newlocking should be accompanied by mail or a note to Zeran.

A god must be at least level 108 to wizlock the game.
~
109 DENY~
Syntax: deny <name>

Deny locks a character out of a game permanently, rendering their character
name unusable.  It may only be removed by editing the file, for this reason
freeze is usually preferred.
~
107 DISCONNECT~
Syntax: disconnect <name>

Disconnect breaks a player's link to the game, dumping them back to the telnet
prompt.  This is a non-lethal way of getting rid of spammers and annoying
players.
~
107 FREEZE~
Syntax: freeze <name>

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing a 
troublemaker is usually a better option than they deny command.
~
103 FORCE~
Syntax: force <character> <command>
Syntax: force all <command>

FORCE forces one character to execute a command, except of course delete.

Below level 107 (Deity) force can only be used on mobiles, and force all is
unavailable.  You also cannot 'force orc murder hugo', for example. 

FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.
This is typically used for 'force all save'.
~
106 SOCKETS~
Syntax: sockets
	sockets <name> 

SOCKETS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including 
users in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside brackets are the 
channel number and the 'connected' state.  The 'connected' states are listed in 
merc.h: 0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of logging in.

The optional name argument shows the site of a player, or optional can be used
to identify switched gods (i.e. socket orc shows the name of anyone switched
into an orc).
~
104 LOAD~
Syntax: load mob <vnum>
	load obj <vnum> <level>

The load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to 
duplicate strung items and mobs).  The vnums can be found with the vnum
command, or by stat'ing an existing mob or object.

Load puts objects in inventory if they can be carried, otherwise they are
put in the room.  Mobiles are always put into the same room as the god. Old
format objects must be given a level argument to determine their power, new
format objects have a preset level that cannot be changed without set.
(see also clone, vnum, stat)
~
108 SET~
Syntax: set mob   <mobile><field> <value>
	set obj   <object> <field> <value>
	set room  <number> <field> <value>
	set skill <char>   <name>  <rating>
	set skill <char>   all     <rating>
        set clan  <clan>    <field> <value>
 
The set command is used to change the numerical values of the various data
structures. Type set <class> without an argument to see a listing of options.
Set skill all (pc's only) will set all the character's skills to the value
given.  Use string to change the strings on an object or mobile.
(see also string, stat)
 
For Information on {Mset char{x options, read {Whelp setchar{x.
~
105 STRING~
Syntax: string obj <field> <string>
	string mob <field> <string>

The string command changes the various strings associated with an object or
mobile.  A full list of fields can be viewed by typing string obj or string
mob.  Sorry, multi-line strings are not yet supported.
~
105 NOCHANNEL NOEMOTE NOSHOUT NOTELL~
Syntax: nochannel <character>
	noemote   <character>
	noshout   <character>
	notell    <character>

Noemote, noshout, and notell are used to muffle other characters, by
preventing them from emoting, shouting, and telling, respectively.
Characters who are noshout'ed or no'telled will also not receive those
forms of communication.

The nochannel command is similar, but more drastic. It prevents the victim
from using any of the channels (gossip, auction, Q/A, music) on the game.
Nochannels usually result from swearing or spamming on public channels.
~
107 PARDON~
Syntax: pardon <character> killer
	pardon <character> thief

Pardon pardons a player for their crimes.  Don't pardon a player unless you
are sure they deserve it.  Being killed by Hassan acts as an automatic
pardon.
~
103 PURGE~
Syntax: purge
	purge <character>

Purge is used to clean up the world.  Purge with no arguments removes all the
NPC's and objects in the current room.  Purge with an argument purges one
character from anywhere in the world.

Purge will not get rid of PC's, or objects or mobiles with a NOPURGE flag
set (i.e. the pit, the fountain, shopkeepers, Hassan).  Mobiles may be
purged if they are called directly by name.
~
106 RESTORE~
Syntax: restore <character>
	restore room
	restore all

Restore restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to the
target character.  It also heals poison, plague, and blindness.

Restore room (or restore with no argument) performs a restore on every player
in the room, restore all does the same for all connected players. Restore all
is only usable by creators and implementors.  Restore should be used sparingly
or not at all.
~
107 SLAY~
Syntax: slay <character>

Slay kills a character in cold blood, no saving throw.  Best not to use this
command on players if you enjoy being a god.
~
105 TRANSFER TELEPORT~
Syntax: transfer <character>
	transfer all
	transfer <character> <location>
	transfer all         <location>

Transfer transfers the target character, or ALL player characters,
to your current location (default) or to a specified location. Trans all 
should almost never be used, as 100 players popping into one room can have
horrible effects on slow links. Teleport is a synonym for transfer. 
~
104 AT~
Syntax: at <location> <command>

At executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given
location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of
a mobile, or as the name of an object.

At works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the
command, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your
location).
~
104 ECHO GECHO PECHO~
Syntax: echo  <message>
	gecho <message>
	pecho <character> <message>

These commands all perform similar functions.  Echo sends the message to
all characters in the same room as the user, with no indication of who sent
it.  Gecho does the same for all players connected to the game, and pecho
sends the message to the player specified as the target.  Any higher-level
god will see a prompt in front of your message, informing him or her that it
is an echo.
~
102 GOTO~
Syntax: goto <location>

Goto takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,
as the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object.

You may not Goto a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present. Some other rooms are barred to players below a certain
god level.
~
102 HOLYLIGHT WIZINVIS CLOAK~
Syntax: holylight
	winvis <level>
	cloak  <level>

Holylight is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

Wizinvis takes a level argument, and will make you invisible to all players of
a lower level than your invisibility level.  It defaults to the maximum
(your level) if no argument is given.  Wizi 110 characters are totally
invisible. Typing invis is the same thing.

Cloak is similar to wizinvis, except that people in the room with you
can still see you.  Great for when you want to talk to someone without
being wizinvis but still want to be hidden from the rest of the world.    
~
102 MEMORY~
Syntax: memory

Memory reports current size and number of things allocated to memory.

The 'Mobs' and 'Objs' lines report the number of types of mobiles and objects,
not the number of instances currently in the game.

The 'Strings' line shows memory used by area-file strings.  These strings have
a maximum limit, which is also shown. With SSM installed, typing memory will
also check to see if the "String Heap" needs to be "Defragged" and report the
results of this to you.

If you are using OverFlow strings, then you need to increase the amount of
memory allocated to strings. OverFlow strings are not very efficient.

The 'Perms' line shows permanently allocated memory blocks.  There is no limit
on the number and size of these blocks.

See Also: memlog
~
106 VNUM~
Syntax: vnum <name>
	vnum <obj or mob> <name>
	vnum skill <name>

Vnum finds all objects and mobiles with a particular name, and prints out
the results.  Use vnum obj or vnum mob to limit the search.  This vnum is
very useful for loading. Vnum skill returns the skill number (for set) and
the slot number (for making new areas) of a skill name.
(see also load)
~
102 ISTAT~
Syntax: istat <name>
	istat mob  <name>
	istat obj  <name>
	istat room <number>

The istat command gives you detailed information on an object, mobile, or room
within the game.  Without a class argument, the command will return a object
(if found), a mobile (if no object exists, but a mobile does), or a room 
(if a number is  given).  Istat room with no argument stats the room you are
standing in.  Istat can be used to find room vnums for goto.
(see also goto, transfer)
 
You may also istat skills, but these stats may not yet all 
be changed.
 
Note: This command was renamed to make way for a player "stat" command which
is totally different.
~
102 MWHERE~
Syntax: mwhere <name>

Mwhere shows you the locations of all mobiles with a particular name.
~
102 PEACE~
Syntax: peace
Syntax: peace world

Peace causes all characters in a room to stop fighting, and forces them to sit
to prevent aggression until the next reset.
 
Peace world does the same thing, except globally (But only in rooms where there
is currently a player, so it may not be safe to move around without being
agressed against.)
~
102 POOFIN POOFOUT~
Syntax: poofin  <message>
Syntax: pooffout <message>

The standard messages for goto are 'arrives in a swirling mist' and
'leaves in a swirling mist'.  You can replace these messages with messages of
your own choosing using the poofin and poofout commands.  These messages
must include your name somewhere in the string.

Poofin and poofout only show to characters who can see you.
(see also goto)
~
105 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax: log   <character>
	log   all
	snoop <character>

Log <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like Freeze, it is a permanent character toggle.
Logs may only be used by creators and implementors, and should be accompanied
by mail to Lotherius.

Certain commands (Password) are protected against log.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

Log all logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots. Please do not use this unless you tell Zeran.

Snoop shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time. Try to respect privacy.  Abuse of snoop will
incur severe punishment.

Snoop yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.
~
104 SWITCH RETURN~
Syntax: switch <character>
	return

Switch switches you into the body of another character (who must not
already have a descriptor, e.g. you can't switch into a PC). You also cannot
switch into link-dead PCs.

Return returns you to your original body.
~
101 IMMTALK IMPTALK:~
Syntax: immtalk <message>
Syntax: imptalk <message>
	immtalk

Immtalk sends a message to all immortals.  : is a synonym for immtalk.
Using this command with no argument turns off the immortal channel (or
turns it back on).

Imptalk is a private channel for the implementors, works similar to 
immtalk.
~
101 WIZHELP~
Syntax: wizhelp

Wizhelp provides a list of all the immortal commands.
~
0 'ABSORB MAGIC'~
Syntax: cast 'absorb magic'

This spell grants the caster extra protection against offensive magical
attacks, by allowing the caster to absorb and dissipate spells aimed
at hurting him/her.  Not every spell will be absorbed, but enough
probably will to make a significant difference in a tough fight. 
~
0 ARMOR_SPELL~
Syntax: cast armor <target>
This spell improves the armour of the target character or mob by a small
amount.
 
See Also: {GARMOR{w

0 'CHARM PERSON'~
Syntax: cast 'charm person' <victim>

This spell, if successful, causes the victim to follow you and to take orders
from you.  Use ORDER to order your charmed followers.

You are responsible for the actions of your followers.  Conversely, other
people who attack your followers will be penalized as if they attacked you.
~
0 'CHILL TOUCH'~
Syntax: cast 'chill touch' <victim>

This spell inflicts damage on the victim and also reduces the victim's
strength by one.

~
0 'DISPEL MAGIC' CANCELLATION~
Syntax: cast 'dispel magic' <character>
        cast 'cancellation' <characte>
 
Both of these spells remove magical effects from the target.  Dispel magic
has a reduced chance of working, and is considering an attack spell.
Cancellation can only be used on allies, but is much more effective and does
not provoke attack.  Unfortunately, the spells do not discriminate between
harmful and benign spells.
 
The chance of dispelling is based on the level of the spell. Permanent spells
(such as mobile sanctuary) are much harder to remove.  Not all spells may
be dispelled, notable examples are poison and plague.

Note:  Cancellation does not require a verbal incantation, so it can
be cast even when the caster is mute.
~
0 EARTHQUAKE~
Syntax: cast 'earthquake'

This spell inflicts damage on every enemy character in the room.
Beware that other characters who are not yet fighting may attack
you as a result!

This spell magically enchants a weapon, increasing its to-hit and to-dam
bonuses by one or two points.  Multiple enchants may be cast, but as the
weapon grows more and more powerful, it is more likely to be drained or
destroyed by the magic.  Also, every successful enchant increases the level
of the weapon my one...and there is no turning back.
~
-1 'ENCHANT ARMOR'~
The enchant armor spell imbues armor with powerful protective magics. It is
not nearly as reliable as enchant weapon, being far more prone to destructive
effects.  Each succesful enchant increases the plus of the armor by 1 or 2
points, and raises its level by one.
~
0 'ENERGY DRAIN'~
Syntax: cast 'energy drain' <victim>

This spell saps the experience points, mana, and movement points of its
target.

including the caster.
~
0 MUTE~
Syntax: cast 'mute' <victim>

The mute spell renders a victim speechless.  The victim cannot cast spells,
except for ones that do not require verbal incantation. (ie, cancellation)
Also, a victim cannot use the 'say' command.
~
0 'KNOW ALIGNMENT'~
Syntax: cast 'know alignment' <character>

This spell reveals the alignment of the target character.
~
0 'LOCATE OBJECT'~
Syntax: cast 'locate object' <name>

This spell reveals the location of all objects with the given name.
~
0 'MASK SELF'~
Syntax: cast 'mask self' <mob>

This spell gives you nearly the full appearance of the target mob.  Anyone
casually walking into the room you occupy, or scanning from a distance
will not be able to distinguish you from a mob.  Looking directly at
you will still reveal your real equipment, so the masking isn't perfect.
However, it is very good for avoiding detection.
~
0 'MIND MELD'~
Syntax: cast 'mind meld' <target>

The mind meld spell is a powerful psionic attack upon the mental faculties
of an opponent.  If successful, the spell delivers a powerful damaging
blow, as well as temorarily crippling the mind of the opponent.  Affected

from any attack by a creature of the specified alignment by one quarter.

The SANCTUARY spell reduces the damage taken by the character from any attack
by one half. Sanctuary may only be cast on characters with a GOOD alignment.

These spells may be used simultaneously for cumulative effect.
~
0 'GHOST FORM'~

~
0 VENTRILOQUATE~
Syntax: cast ventriloquate <speaker> <message>

This spell throws your voice, making it appear that some other object or
character in the room is saying your message.  Victims who make their saving
throw will know that someone is using ventriloquism, but not who.  Victims who
fail their saving throw will think that the object or character really did say
your message.
~
0 VOCALIZE~
Syntax: cast 'vocalize' <character>

The vocalize spell allows the recipient to cast spells without the use
of verbal incantations.  Thus, a player affected by both "mute" and
"vocalize" could still cast spells.
~
0 WEAKEN~

~
0 'WORD OF RECALL'~

frost can break objects, and acid can damage armor.

~
0 COLOUR COLOR ANSI~
Syntax: colour    Toggles colour mode on/off

        You may use "colour codes" in many places on the mud (such
        as on chat channels). To do so, use the format below to make
        the colours each displays in.
                
                {r{{r {R{{R {c{{c {C{{C {g{{g {G{{G
                {y{{y {Y{{Y {b{{b {B{{B {m{{m {M{{M
                {d{{d {D{{D {w{{w {W{{W {x{{x (Reset)

        Additionaly, there are other codes that offer special formatting
        and similar options.
                
                {{{{     {{ char     {{*       beep
                {{/     newline    {{3       Underline{x

                {{#     {# Sign     {{-       {- Sign



	Note that not all codes work on all terminals. This is not
	the fault of the mud, but a fault of some terminals.
        Also, {Wif you don't wish to see reverse or flashing, type
        "config noflashy"{w, and if you don't want to, or can't, see
        the dark grey colour, type "config darkgrey". If you don't
        want to see bright colours at all, type "config darken".

~
0 PKILL BOUNTY KILLER~
Pkill is not a requirement of SunderMud. However, it is available in
several instances.
 
1) If you are in a clan that has the "allowpk" flag set, then you
will be able to PK and be PK'd by members of other clans with that
same flag set. Normally, this would only be allowed in PKILL enabled
rooms, however, if the two clans are at war, this will be anywhere.
 
2) If you set the KILLER flag on yourself. In this case, you'll be
able to kill anyone else who also has the KILLER flag set. Of course,
you cannot be a KILLER in a clan that does not have "allowpk", but
you can be a KILLER if you aren't in a clan at all.
 
3) Anyone with the THIEF flag set is open to be killed by anyone,
regardless of these other rules, including those in non-pk clans.
However, individual clan rules may vary, so contact your leader.
 
To set the killer flag on yourself, type "killer" followed by your
password. You can not undo KILLER status without intervention from
an immortal, and if you have actually PK'd after setting the flag,
it is not likely it will be removed.
 
Thieves can get the THIEF flag if they are caught stealing from other
players, and this makes them a target for being killed. They can also
receive the THIEF flag by getting caught robbing the bank.
 
Clans can put out BOUNTIES on Killers, Thieves, and anyone in a
warring clan.
~
0 NOTIFY~
The notify system was written to provide players with a customizable 
method of seeing various events happening on the mud.  Many events
are broadcast over the notify system:

player logins, player quits, player lost links, player deaths, 
player leveling, player deleting, clan joining, clan acceptance,
clan promotions, clan quitting, clan declaring war and peace, and
more.

Notify messages can be sent to all players or sometimes just members
of a specific clan, as such, setting clan related events ON or OFF 
may or may not have a noticable effect.

Using the notification system is simple.  Typing 'notify' by itself
will show the status of all your notify channel events.  Typing
'notify <event>' will toggle that event ON or OFF.  If you want
to turn all the events ON, just type 'notify all'.  Similarly,
to turn all events OFF, just type 'notify none'.

0 BREW~
Syntax:  brew <spell>
The brew command allows clerics to attempt to create potions.  Brewing
a potion of a specific spell requires several things.  First, the spell
must be known by the cleric, and it must be a spell that is allowed
to be brewed.  Generally, most non-offensive spells are brewable.  There
is a monetary cost, a mana cost, and component requirements for brewing
as well.  Specifics vary from spell to spell.  Some components are harder
to find than others.  Potions do not last forever, they will evaporate
eventually.
~
0 SCRIBE~
Syntax:  scribe <spell>
The scribe command allows a mage to attempt to create scrolls of various
spells.  Scribing a spell requires several things.  First, the spell must
be known to the mage, and it must be a spell that is allowed to be scribed.
There is a monetary cost, a mana cost, and component requirements for
scribing spells.  First, you must have sheets of vellum, each spell requires
a fresh sheet.  Depending on the particular spell, there may also be a 
second material component required, but this will be a rare occurence.
Scrolls will eventually dry up and crumble to dust if not used.
~
0 NEWBIE_INFO_OLD~
This mud has enormous changes from Rom 2.3, so don't expect to see all the
usual things here. Classes are designed very different, and the world has
been rebuilt from scratch. Clans are supported as well (help clans) and
the gods look highly upon players who take an active interest in a clan,
whether it be as a member of an existing clan or generating support for a
new clan. 
If you have never played a mud before, please use the help system before
you ask questions. Most things are covered in there (type "HELP" by itself
to get some basics on using help and some necessary topics).
~
103 hedit~
syntax: edit help <keyword>
 
Allows online editing of helpfiles.
 
To see commands available, type "commands" from within the help 
editor. 
 
To quit, type "done".
 
To save, type "save" from within the editor.
~
-1 hlist~
syntax: hlist <minlevel> <maxlevel>
syntax: hlist index <string>
syntax: hlist search <string>
syntax: hlist
 
HLIST is a utility designed for listing appropriate helpfile 
keywords when you are not sure of the exact helpfile that you 
need to read.
 
There are four methods listed for using HLIST above. The simplest
is with no options. This lists all helpfiles which you have access
to.
 
hlist search <string>
Searches for <string> within the keywords *OR* text of a helpfile.
Can often return more results than you expected (try a search on
spell sometime)
hlist index <string>
Searches for <string> only within the keywords of helpfiles. Useful
for looking for all helpfiles with say, "clan" in the keywords.
 
hlist <minlevel> <maxlevel>
Shows all helpfiles within the level range specified. Mostly useful
only for immortals who wish to see immortal helpfiles only (and thus
level is only available to immortals)
~
0 exorcism~
syntax: cast 'exorcism' <target>
 
Exorcism is a spell for holy priests only, that calls upon
the power of their deity to aid them in their mission. If 
the priest is holy enough, his deity will
his aid.
~
0 SEARCH~
syntax:  search
syntax:  search <container>

All characters can attempt to search for concealed objects.  Search by
itself will search for concealed objects in the room you're in.  Search
<container> will search inside the specified container.  Character level,
object level, and intelligence all affect chance for success.
~
0 BUILDING~
Building for SunderMud is done through the use of OLC, or On-Line 
Creation. It provides access to all building features of the mud, 
unlike building programs such as SPAM or MZF. These utilities, 
and others like them, cannot be used with SunderMud because the 
file formats and features are not supported in such utilities 
(at press time). If you really must, you could still build by using
a text editor, but you would have to ask an Immortal if they could
provide a document detailing the areafile format for Sunder.

	In order to be considered for a building position, you will be
assigned a small test area to design.  A few rooms, mobiles, and objects
should be created, so that the staff can evaluate your writing skills,
imagination (with the understanding that this is just a tiny test sample),
and ability to follow the general building guidelines.  Other factors
that should not be forgotten are friendly attitude, willingness to
accept constructive criticism, and ability to work with others.  If
accepted as a builder, you may be asked to work in a small team to
create a section of the world that is larger than just one area. 

	Before asking to be tested as a builder, you should read the history
and theme of SunderMud. ("help history" & "help theme")  This will help
you to understand what sorts of areas for which we may be looking.  Some
area ideas that are *not* wanted are futuristic areas and heavy book
story areas.  Using themes from books is alright, as long as any possible
copyrighted material is not used.  This material includes but is not
limited to: unique character names, item names, and city names.  If you
aren't sure about the acceptability of something, please ASK.  The
head builder or Imps will discuss the situation with you and make a
final ruling.

	When it comes time to build an area, there are many guidelines that you
should keep in mind.   Please read 'help guide' before doing any serious
building.  It answers many common questions and gives some excellent tips
to make areas better.  Areas that are built without following the guidelines
will require a great deal of re-editting before being linked in.  It is
up to the builder (or builders if a joint effort) to clean up the areas
as requested by the head builder or Imps.  Areas will not be linked to the
world until examined and approved by the head builder.  If a serious
disagreement takes place between a builder and the head builder, the Imps
will step in to try to work things out.  Generally, problems can be solved 
peacefully if everyone is willing to keep an open mind.  

	After you've perused the other help files (theme, history, guide),
contact either the head builder or one of the Imps if you wish to pursue
a possible building position.

0 GUIDE GUIDELINES~
Building Tips And Suggestions
(Originally from Curious Areas Workshop Builder's Tips, 
 with Comments by Lotherius )
 
Areas should be well-fleshed out stories that catch the visitor's attention
and bring out their curiosity, making them want to stay for more. The
descriptions should be well fleshed out, bringing images into the players'
minds, and there should be challenges and tricks that the player will not
expect, after all, even the best descriptions can only go so far.

                               General Tips

The first tip is to learn how to build without an Diku editor first.
Editors are wonderful tools that definitely make life easy in the long run,
but if you know how the files are put together, and why they are how they
are, it becomes a lot easier to troubleshoot.

( Note: This first paragraph is not 100% applicable to SunderMud, since
 with the use of OLC, you are removed from being able to troubleshoot
 anything directly. - Lotherius )

Before starting work on an area, talk it over with the person in charge of
the theme and world on the mud you are building it for. Make sure that your
idea of the theme is very similar to theirs. Otherwise, you may end up
building something that doesn't fit the world at all. Also, suggestions
from the other person may allow you to incorporate plot elements from the
rest of the world, which would further integrate your area with the rest of
the world.

Once you have your idea refined and compatible with the rest of the mud's
world, draw your area on paper. Do it big. The reason for this is that
during the building process, aggravation and editing always make the area
shrink, sometime rapidly. Also, having a visual map to work from helps
immensely with exits, and provides a visual impetus for putting together
the last (and often most tedious) bits.

Plots are extremely important in areas. Your area should have a strong plot
which is well incorporated into it. Some ways of incorporating plots are in
descriptions of mobiles when you look at them. Extra descriptions in rooms
are always useful for trails, scrapings on the wall, or whatnot. Trash
objects can be created that are notes, maps, or whatever. One excellent
idea from Lok is to create a no-take container without a long description,
with the short description the ground, and inside this container, put a
'buried' treasure. When players get the treasure from the container, it
will appear like You get the treasure from the ground. This kind of trick
catches the interest of most players, and power mudders will more than
likely miss this kind of trick the first few times through.

When designing your area and the plots within, you should always consider
what kind of player you want playing in your area. Keep the levels and
types in mind (ie role-playing, power-mudder, etc). In doing so, try to
have fun building the area. Make it well-rounded and something that you
enjoy looking through afterwards. If you find something you don't like,
edit it and change it until you like it. It is always best to build when
you are not bored of the area, since building when you are bored almost
always turns out uninspired and boring areas.

Most builders do not take the possible ecology or economic effects of an
area into account. By this, I don't mean having a mini-model of an actual
ecological enviroment, but rather having things that make the area seem more
plausible. The best things to put in to make an area more plausible are
useless objects that actually add atmosphere to the area. Food sources for
the mobiles in your area are always neccessary to fleshing things out, as
are creating import and export goods for cities, complete with customs
houses.

Finally, when writing the numerous descriptions of the area, MAKE THEM
INTERESTING TO READ! Nobody likes to read room after room of stupid one
line descriptions. Vary each description as much as possible. One of the
greatest joys of most players is finding new and interesting rooms, items,
treasures, and monsters. For those of you familiar with role-playing games,
this creative use of descri~
103 REPOP~
Syntax: repop [room_vnum]
Syntax: repop
 
The repop command forces a reset of the specified room. This repop
ignores the restriction on having players in the area when deciding
whether to repop objects in the room.
 
Without an argument, the repop command refers to the current room.
~
0 ALIAS ALIASES UNALIAS~
Syntax: alias 'name' 'command string'
Syntax: unalias 'name'

Do not enter the alias using the ' ' marks.

The Alias command lets you specify macros that execute more complex 
commands with a short sequence of keystrokes.

Unalias will clear an existing alias.
See Also: Multi
~
0 'MULTIPLE COMMANDS' 'MULTIPLE' 'MULTI'~
This mud has the capability for entering multiple commands.
 
To do so, insert a | character between the commands you would
like to execute. You can use this character in aliases as well.
 
On your keyboard, the | character (called a pipe) will look similar
to the colon, but have a tiny break in the middle.
See Also: Alias
~
0 'FRENZY'~
Some spellcasters have mastered a spell that allows them to simulate the
warriorly art of berserking. This spell is called frenzy.
~
0 'INVIS' 'INVISIBILITY'~
A few masterful spellcasters have come up with a sure-fire method to
become invisible to most others. Be forewarned though, if thou attackest,
the invisibility will come off, and also some creatures can detect the
invisibility.
~
0 ZONE ZONES~
The world is divided into several seperate zones. These allow you to
quickly see which areas are near other areas. In the future, gate will
also be limited to the current zone, as will also recall (but not word of
recall).
 
If you are looking for a list of "zones" on this mud, then type the 
command "{Wareas{x" or read help areas.
~
0 deity~
The deities in SunderMud are numerous as the stars in the sky, but the
primary conflict is between Roqmin and Aecindo.  A list of deities and their
beliefs follows.  
 
Aecindo: The "First" god, he is dedicated to restoring Order to the world.
Lukhan:  Aecindo's son (technically all the gods are his children though)
         He still works closely with Aecindo, but puts a stronger emphasis
         on goodness of one's heart rather than rules.
Roqmin:  Roqmin is dedicated to ultimate freedom, the kind that can only be
         gained when chaos rules. He resists Aecindo's efforts to restore
         the singularity of the deities.
Thuahamin: God of Ultimate Evil to some, but the god of self-expression and
         freedom to others. His principles often coincide with Roqmin's,
         indeed, their followers often work together. One main difference is
         that while he believes in freedom, he also maintains that those that
         can't handle freedom don't deserve it. 
Freyhana: Goddess of Beauty. Her followers worship her although she is as far
         as anyone knows, dead, being the only god to have ever died.
Shari:   Goddess of Love. It is said that Shari was Freyhana's murderer, that
         she killed her in a fit of jealous rage.
Cinda:   Deputy of Neutrality. Cinda refuses the title God or Goddess, and 
         almost never makes appearences, and always through an avatar. Nobody
         knows Cinda's gender, if Cinda has one. Cinda is known to act only
         when the balance is disturbed to some level, but has never been 
         known to form lasting alliances. Even the other Gods rarely see
         the Deputy of Neutrality.
~
0 'RP' 'ROLE-PLAYING' 'ROLEPLAY' 'ROLE PLAYING'~
This mud does NOT require role-playing. However, role-playing is encouraged
and greatly enhances your gameplay.

What is role-playing?
For those who are unfamiliar with role-playing, it means getting past
the numbers of the game and developing the personality of your character
as something {Wunique and different from yourself{x that fits into the type
of world we have created rather than the modern-day world. It's sort of like
acting, where you have no script to go by, you just get "in character" and 
sort of ad lib as you go. A good role-player will create an entire life for
his character, and live this life somewhat, that is totally unrelated to the
killing of creatures or gathering of treasure which permeates some muds.
~
102 home~
The home command allows immortals to automatically return to their
selected "home" room.
To set this, find the vnum of the room you want to be your "home" and
type: {Whome <vnum>{w
~
102 listskills~
listskills <options>
 
Listskills is a utility to view all skills on the mud in 
a variety of output formats.
 
Type listskills with no options to see the valid options.
~
0 chaos~
Syntax: cast 'chaos' <target>
 
Chaos is a spell available to those who delve into the chaotic magics. M
Actually, it is more a rather simple spell to execute, but hard to protect
from. Once the caster unleashes this spell, he has opened a channel to the
pure magic forces from another plane which simple rip through him, and 
tear through everything in the room, doing damage.
Chaos does damage in a multitude of ways, since the magics from other 
planes are very unpredictable.
~
0 SUNDER SUNDERMUD~
The Story of SunderMud.
 
A long time ago (1996) in a Galaxy far, far away (Ohio) a mud resided on a
hard disk that called itself 'Dark Times'. The Great Gods (Lotherius & Zeran)
of Dark Times were sick of muds which had nothing unique to them at all, so
they declared that Dark Times would not open until it was unique in a certain
number of ways. This included balanced classes and unique areas.
Alas, one of the Gods slacked off (Lotherius), and then the other did too
(Zeran) and the mud was abandonded, having never opened for several months.

Then, in September 1997, one of the Gods (Lotherius) decided to start work
again. Without the aid of the other, he set off in his own direction, to build
the mud the way He wanted to see a mud built.

Thus came SunderMud 1, in all of its incomplete glory.

Lotherius later continued the project, with some help from Zeran in 1999, then
the code was lost when Zeran literally disappeared from the face of the earth, and
it was upon his machine the mud resided.

Then, a miraculous event happened in July 2001. Lotherius found a backup of the
SunderMud code, and resurrected work on SunderMud ][.

SunderMud 2.0 Beta was released in 2002.
SunderMud 2.1 was released in June 2003.

0 NOTE 'NOTE WRITE' 'NOTE READ' BOARD 'NOTE SYSTEM' BOARDS~
Syntax:

board [number|name]                     Shows or changes board.
note                                    Reads next note.
note read [number]                      Reads a certain note.
note remove <number>                    Removes a note written by you.
note list [number]                      Shows up to number notes.
note write                              Posts a note.
note catchup                            Marks all notes in this board read.

These commands are used for the new note system. Instead of just one board, 
there are several, each with its special purpose. 

Changing between the boards is accomplished using the BOARD command. BOARD
without any arguments gives you a list of all boards together with number of
unread message. To change, type BOARD <number> or BOARD <name of the board>.

To read next unread note, type NOTE. To read a note with a specified number,
type NOTE READ <number>. Typing NOTE while in a board with no unread notes
shifts you to the next board. Note that unlike the standard note system, a 
note has the same number in NOTE LIST and NOTE READ.

Posting a message is as simple as writing NOTE WRITE. You will be moved 
into interactive mode, where all you see are prompts for the fields like 
To:, From: etc. You will be automatically put AFK while writing a note.

To see the list of the notes in the current board, type NOTE LIST. Typing
NOTE LIST <number> will list only <number> of the last notes in the area.

You can remove your own note by using NOTE REMOVE <number>. Implementors may
remove other people's notes. Implementors can also select how many days
their note is kept before being purged. Purging happens automatically at
bootup. Purged notes are not deleted, but saved into a file.

To let only immortals see your note, address it to "imm". To let players of
a specific level and above, address it to that level (no other recipients may
appear in that case).

This board system was created by Erwin S. Andreasen, erwin@pip.dknet.dk, aka
Phunk and is freely available. The general outlook was based on Mystic 
Adventure's note system (mud.gel.ulaval.ca 4000).
~
0 fullfight~
syntax: fullfight
 
This toggles extra descriptions of actions used during fighting, such 
as dodges, parries, etc.
~
0 CHAOSMAGE~
Chaosmages are mage of the school of Chaos.  The primary difference in
this school of study is that the mage is taught more powerful methods of
channeling the magical energies into his spells.  Chaosmages tend to take
far greater risks than tradition allows, and often pay in blood for these
risks.  Many consider it worth the dangers for the powerful magics they
work.  
~
0 recruit~
Recruit: Automatic Skill
 
Recruit is a skill for warriors only that allows them
to gain followers automatically as they adventure around
the world.
 
This skill effectively charms random mobs, who must be
of like alignment to you. Once they are following, you
have the opportunity to group them and have them assist
in your adventures.
 
If you would prefer to not have automatic recruit, or 
would like to remove those following you, use the
nofollow command.
~
0 entropy~
Syntax: cast 'entropy' <victim>
 
Entropy will surround the victim with a field of entropy that can damage 
his / her equipment, thus lowering AC or other things, or even causing
it to become useless if it was already worn.
~
102 immtitle~
Syntax: immtitle <string>
 
Your immtitle can be up to 15 characters long, including color codes.
This is what shows in the who list instead
of race.
~
103 item_furniture~
v0: Number Players Allowed
v1: Weight Allowed (currently unused)
v2: Bitfield (See Below)
v3: Heal % - 0% is default heal. Negatory values remove heal.
 
The BitField determines how the furniture may be used.
Common values are:
73     -- Allows sit, rest & sleep "at"
146    -- sit, rest & sleep "on"
292    -- sit, rest & sleep "in"
 
To Make Further Values:
Add together the numbers from the table below for the flags you want
to be turned on. Remember, if you set more than one type of sit, rest, or
sleep (ie, you set "sit at" and "sit on" both) it will take the first.
You should have a maximum of three flags. Once you add the numbers, put
that total in your bitfield (v2).
SIT AT      : 1
SIT ON      : 2
SIT IN      : 4
REST AT     : 8
REST ON     : 16
REST IN     : 32
SLEEP AT    : 64
SLEEP ON    : 128
SLEEP IN    : 256
~
0 furniture bitfield~
~
103 setrent~
syntax: SETRENT <number>
 
SetRent will set the value on a room that is marked rentable. 
The number specified is the cost for the room per month that it 
is being rented. This number may not be set lower than 25,000 gold
per month. The default amount in SM2:DT is 500,000 coins. It is
suggested that this amount not be lowered normally.
 
This command is seperate from OLC, since rental information is 
saved in its own file.
~
0 private~
SYNTAX: private
 
This toggle allows a person who is leasing a room to control
access to that room. When Private is enabled, the entrance to
the room will be totally invisible to outsiders, and nobody may
enter the room except for the person renting.
 
When Private is disabled, though, the room can be accessed
normally by anyone. Anybody who is in the room at the time Private
is enabled may remain in the room, and exit at their leisure, 
but cannot return until Private is disabled.

If the lease is owned by a clan, PRIVATE will bar all non-clan
members from entering, unless the clans are at war.
~
0 lease~
Not to be confused with pfile rent, Lease code here is something 
completely different.
 
When you lease a room, it becomes yours to do with as you please.
A room can be leased for up to 1 Mud Year (17 mud months) in advance.
One mud year is *approximately** 5 days in Real Life time. This means
you need to keep current on your rent. You can add months to the
current number you have rented, so if you are only rented for
5 months, you can rent 12 more to make up the year.
 
Commands Related to Leasing Are:
{Ylease:{x this command allows you to view current lease options,
view how many months you have current remaining on your lease,
and to lease more months.
Syntax to view options/info: lease
Syntax to lease time: lease <num>
<num> is any number of months up to 17, that will not bring your
current lease to over 17 months.

{Ymyleases: This shows all the leases you have around the mud, and
how long you have left before they expire, if not paid up.
 
{Yprivate:{x This command toggles access to your leased room.
There is a seperate helpfile for private.
 
{Yroomname:{x Allows you to set the name of your leased room.
Syntax is : roomname <name of room>
Maximum length of name, including colour codes, is 45 characters.
 
{Yroomdesc:{x Takes you into the description editor for your
leased room. Try to avoid overly lengthy or ridiculous descriptions
for your room. *WARNING* Lewd, Crude, Raunchy, or Offensive
descriptions WILL get your lease revoked and a NO_LEASE flag set
on your character. When in the editor, type .h for help.
~
0 QUEST QUESTS~
Certain characters in the game will allow you to go on quests to recover an
item or kill another mob. To go on a quest, you must be in the same room with
a questmaster. When you successfully complete a quest, you will receive a
certain number of quest points. These points may be saved up and used to buy
incredible items from the questmaster.

The QUEST command is used for information about your current quest, to request
a quest from a questmaster, etc. Commands are as follows:

QUEST POINTS - Gives your current number of quest points. This command may be
used anywhere.

QUEST INFO - If you are on a quest, this will remind you who or what you are
after.

QUEST TIME - Gives the amount of time remaining on your current quest, or the
amount of time until you can request another quest. This command may be used
anywhere.

QUEST REQUEST - Petitions the questmaster to send you on a quest. If you
accept the quest, you will be given a realtime limit (in minutes) in which you
must complete the quest. If you are on a quest to kill a creature, when you
come across that creature you will see a [TARGET] notice before it. This is
the creature you are to kill.

QUEST COMPLETE - Once you have completed your quest and recovered the item or
killed the mob or whatever, you must return to the questmaster who sent you on
the quest and use this command. If you have successfully completed your quest,
he will reward you with gold and quest points. Once you complete a quest you
cannot request another for 10 minutes.

QUEST LIST - Displays the list of fabulous items for sale by the questmaster.
These items are not buyable via gold, they must be purchased with quest points.

QUEST BUY <item> - Purchases an item from the questmaster and deducts the cost
of the item from your quest points.
~
102 TELEPOP NO_TELEPOP~
Telepop is the ability of a mob to automagically
teleport ONCE whenever the mob is repoped to an area.
 
This allows a builder to avoid the use of mob chutes, which
are an innefficient way of spreading mobs throughout an area.
 
act_telepop can be set on any mob. If the mob is sentinel, or
stay_area, they will only repop into the area where the reset
is located. Without those flags, they will pop into ANY valid
room in the mud. Please ask for permission before creating 
any GLOBAL telepop mob.
 
To avoid a telepop mob from entering a room, you can use
the ROOM_NOTELEPOP flag on a room. This is usefull for high
profile rooms that it would just not make sense for there to 
be those telepop'd mobs.
 
There *are* other limits on telepop, but you should not
depend on them, rather you should use room_notelepop.
 
(don't worry, private rooms are alsooff limites to telepop)
~
0 kender~
The Kender are a small race whose origins are completely unknown.
They seem to exist on almost every known plane, and are considered
a mild annoyance on almost as many. 
 
They are small and agile, depending mostly on luck to bring them
through their trials. Their social order is such that there is
no concept of ownership, and combined with their extreme agility
and short attention span, this has earned them the name "thieves"
among members of many other races. 
 
Most Kender end up surviving off "charity" from others (ie, 
thief class), though some make their living as warriors, and 
even a few have master magic, albeit only of the chaotic types.
 
Kender recieve "steal" and "peek" as racial abilities.
Kender have permanent Protection Evil (luck)
Kender are resistant to Negative, and vulnerable to Mental attacks.
~
0 minor chaos~
syntax : cast 'minor chaos' <target>
 
This spell calls upon the dweomer surrounding the chaos
mage at time of casting, to cause harm to one's opponent.
The type of damage will vary depending upon what type
of dweomer happens to be around at the time.
~
0 roomname~
syntax: roomname <roomname>
 
Allows you to set the name of a room which you have leased.
The name will be reset when the lease expires. Enter
the command with an argument of up to 45 characters. No
lewd/crude/raunchy/offensive names please. Even *if* you
are playing an evil character.
~
0 roomdesc~
syntax: roomdesc
 
Takes you into the description editor for your leased
room. Try to avoid overly lengthy or ridiculous 
descriptions for your room, but be creative. 
 
{RWARNING{x Lewd, Crude, Raunchy, or Offensive
descriptions WILL get your lease revoked and a NO_LEASE flag
set on your character, or in some cases possible deletion!
 
The description will be reset when the lease expires, so if
you put alot of work into yours, either don't let the lease
expire, or write it down someone outside the mud.
~
0 hometown~
The hometowns of the many races are scattered throughout the lands, in
many different places.
After the Sundering, many moved to the Human city of Lukhan, however, since it
was the most settled city, and the only one in which the quality of life had

1 MSP SOUND~
MSP is Mud Sound Protocol. This allows the mud to instruct your
client (such as ZMud) to play sound files at various times while
you are mudding. This greatly enhances the experience of mudding.
Once you turn this on, you can allow your client to automatically
download each sound file as it is requested, or you can download
them yourself.
 
Mud Clients That Support MSP:
zMUD (v4.60 and higher) 
- PC/Windows. Note that v4.60 is required. You can use 4.60 without
- registering it. It says it will expire, but it will not. Versions
- 5.0 and higher must be registered. For auto-download of sounds,
- you may have to have a newer version.

1 WORLD MAP AUTOMAP~
The World of SunderMud ]] is flat.
Scientists at one time tried to prove otherwise, but they could not
do so.
 
If you have "config automap" enabled, or use the "map" command, you
can see an overhead map of the room you are in and the immediate area.
Do keep in mind, however, that secret doors will never show on the map,
even once you have found them.

dead children, and ravaged fields.  The forces of light and dark continue

ruined city...  {x

~
0 YOUTH AGE~
Syntax: cast age <target>
Syntax: cast youth <target>
 
These spells change the apparent age of the target to either be
younger or older, depending on which spell is used. It does not change
the birthdate of the target.
 
Currently age has no ill effect on a character, however it may do
so in the future.
~
0 AFK REPLAY~
Syntax: afk
Syntax: replay
 
The AFK command flags your character AFK, and makes this 
change in your whois and the who command. Your prompt is changed
during your AFK to a simple {W(AFK){x message, reflecting your
status.
 
You will continue to see tells on your screen while AFK, but may,
when you return, type {Wreplay{x to see any tells you received
while afk.
 
Typing 'afk' a second time removes this status.
~
102 USED UNUSED~
Syntax: used
Syntax: unused
 
The used command works while you are in the OLC room, object, 
or mob editors. It will show you the vnum and short desc of all
instances in your current area that you are editing for the type
you are currently editing.
 
Unused works similarly, except shows you unused vnums which are
still allocated to your area but haven't been used.
 
NOTICE:
If using used and unused gives very wierd results, it is likely
your client has speedwalk expansion on. Turn it off and these commands
will work correctly. This is due to the fact that both of these
words are completely made up of letters that also represent mud
directions :)
 
The {Wused{w command has some special options available depending
upon which editor you are in that are QUITE powerful. You should
read the associated helps to learn how to use them.
 
See Also: {GMOB_USED{w, {GOBJ_USED{w, {GROOM_USED{w.
~
0 SKILLMASTER LEARN~
Syntax: learn list
Syntax: learn <skill|spell>
 
Learn works similarly to practice, but is for skills which require
a skillmaster to teach you.

Some skills are highly specialized, and therefore require the services
of a learned adept at that skill. These skills therefore can only
be learned from those masters, and it is your job to find these if you
wish to gain those specialist skills.
learn list: Shows you the names of the skills or spells that a master
is able to teach you.

0 CLASS HELP~
There are seven class selections in SunderMud ][.
Each class has skills which are unique to that class, as well
as some which are shared with other classes.
 
On SunderMud ][, the non-magical classes gain no spells. This
includes the Warrior, Thief and Monk classes.
 
A brief description of each class:
warrior:        An all-around fighter
monk:           A fighter specialized in martial arts
mage:           A by-the-book mage.
chaosmage:      A magic user whose magic is a bit 'chaotic'
avenger:        Priests of Good Alignments
defiler:        Priests Who Serve Evil
thief:          Makes his living off of other's misfortune.

0 kobold~
Kobolds are dog-people who stand just over one meter tall on average. 
Their bodies are covered with mangy fur of brown, black, or grey color. 
Kobolds have short ears on top of their head that can pivot in almost any
direction, giving them excellent directional hearing sense.  Kobold society
is considered barbaric to many, with cannibalism and cruelty the norm. 
Kobolds rarely have long lives under the best of conditions, and the
continual infighting and bickering among kobolds usually shortens this
considerably.  Kobolds may not be the brightest...  Or the strongest...  Or
much of anything, but they do very well in numbers.  Kobolds gain special
skills which allow them to perform exceptionally well in group situations,
and they can advance levels very quickly.

0 rally~
Syntax: rally
 
The abilities of a great leader include motivating his or her 
comrades during battle. A good leader can rally them on and increase
their effectiveness. This can not only give them better attacks,
but it also helps them endure their wounds with less complaint.
~
0 rom~
SunderMud ][ is based on Rom 2.3 code.
As such, it is bound by the Rom 2.3 license.
 
The Rom 2.4 license {R{&DOES NOT APPLY{x.

Rom 2.3 is written by Russ Taylor.
 
Rom 2.3 license only requires credit to ROM on login screen, does not require
Russ Taylor's name, nor does it require the copyright DATE. (these things
are specified in the utterly ludicrous Rom 2.4 license, along with more).
 
A copy of the Rom 2.3 license is available from the implementor of this
mud upon request.
 
Note also, that this help itself IS NOT REQUIRED by the Rom 2.3 license,
yet I have offered it out of respect to Rom.
 
Now, also not required by the Rom 2.3 license, are the credits for Rom 2.3:

0 SURRENDER~
Syntax: surrender

When you're fighting, you may choose to SURRENDER your opponent. If you
surrender, you will cease fighting. Your opponent may ignore your action
(receiving one free attack) or react in some other way depending on the
situation. Fighting may always be resumed via kill command.
See also: KILL
~
102 MPEDIT OPEDIT RPEDIT~
Syntax: mpedit create <vnum>
Syntax: mpedit <vnum>
 
This command puts you into the mobprog online editor. It works 
much like the other online editors, of which you are familiar with
already. If you are not, you don't need to be doing mobprogs yet :)
 
The VNUM of your mobprog does not have to coincide with the mobile
which it will go to. The same mobprog may also be assigned to several
different mobiles.
 
Once in the editor, you can hit [ENTER] to show the current mobprog,
just like with any other OLC editor.
 
There are only two commands worth noting:
 
code - Enters the line editor where you enter your actual code.
list - lists the vnums of the mobprogs you currently have created.
 
code is where you'll enter the actual program. NOTE that you will
not be including the "trigger" here. That is done on the mobile
with addmprog.
 
This works pretty much the same with opedit and rpedit, so they
don't get their own helpfile :)
~
102 ADDMPROG DELMPROG ADDOPROG DELOPROG ADDRPROG DELRPROG~
Syntax: addmprog [vnum] [trigger] [phrase]
Syntax: delmprog [number]
 
These commands allow you to link/unlink a mobprog to a specific
mob on the mud. You must be in the MOBILE editor to use these commands.
 
ADDMPROG
Links the mobprog specified by [vnum] to the currently edited mobile.
This mobprog will trigger on the [trigger] event, with the parameters
specified in [phrase] (help triggers).
 
DELMPROG
Unlinks the mobprog specified by [number] from the currently edited
mobile. [number] is shown when you view the mobile, to the left of
the trigger phrase.
Notice this does NOT delete the mobprog from memory, rather it
only removes it from the mobile.
 
the Oprog and Rprog versions of this work much the same, for rooms
and objects...

0 enter~
Syntax: enter <portal>
 
<portal> is the name of the portal object you wish to enter.
 
Portals transport you from one location to another. They are objects
that can either be found in areas, bought from questor, or created
with certain spells (example, see portal spell)
 
Portals come in various types. The most common are those that
you enter by stepping in. This type must be used with the portal
on the floor of the room you are in.
 
Other portals me be held, worn floating nerby, or on your neck.
This type of portal is activated by grasping it (you still use the
enter command, however), and do not require that the portal
be on the floor first.
 
Enter will default to the first item it finds by the keyword
you give it, and attempt to use that as a portal, so you must
be specific with the keyword.
 
Pets may only follow you through portals on the floor.
~
0 portal~
Syntas: cast portal <target>
 
The portal spell allows certain magic users to create a mystical tear in
space and time, providing a path to a distant target. This target must
be a creature of some type.
 
Note that only players of the same level or higher than the caster may use
the portal.

syntax: account
syntax: account <name> (IMM ONLY)
syntax: account all    (IMM ONLY)
 
The account command shows your current "ACCOUNT" status within
SunderMud. Among other things, it shows your current Validation
state, whether you are eligible for Demi-Gods or not, as well
as a few statistics, including the names of all of your 
characters under this account.
 
To read further about how ACCOUNTS work on SunderMud, please 
read "ACCOUNT_INFO" helpfile.

For information on the "account" command, see "help account".  
 
ACCOUNTS --
 
SunderMud 2 adds an account tracking system to the base mud, which
radically alters some features of playing while leaving others the 
same.
 
The Primary reason accounts were added was to track player progress
across multiple characters, allowing things such as DemiGods to more
experienced players without the need of immortal intervention.
 
Secondarily, accounts help the immortals by offering a relatively 
simple way to watch for casual multi-playing, which is illegal on 
this mud, while allowing for multiple characters per player to
exist. This is done by associating the accounts with each other so
that the owner of alternate characters is clear.
 
Accounts also provide a means of tracking information partaining to
a character online, while the character itself is offline, by keeping
only vital statistics in RAM at all time.
 
{RVERIFICATION{w
syntax: verify
 
(then follow the directions in the email you receive)
Verification of your account is required to achieve Demi-God status,
as well reaching HERO level on a certain amount of characters (default
is set to 2, this may change).
 
Our policy is to require valid email addresses on all accounts, and
an account may be cancelled for having a bogus email address. However,
normally, we do not require that accounts be verified before you are
able to play. In fact, you may play as many mortals as you like
before verifying your account. {rHowever, if a Staff Member doubts the
validity of your email address, he/she may request that you verify it
within a certain time limit (this can be anywhere down to 1 hour) to
maintain your access to the mud, or may cancel your account if the 
address is obviously invalid, without verification attempt.{w.
 
{YCreating New Characters{w
 
All account-holders, verified or not, may create a finite number of
accounts. Currently this total is set to {G20 characters{w. If you go 
over this amount, you must delete one of your characters to be 
allowed to create another. When you create a new character, you will
be asked for your email address, and a MASTER PASSWORD which you
set when you first created your account. Don't forget this password!
If an immortal is forced to set you a new password, you will be
required to reply to a manual verification email proving that you
did request the change to the master password, and your highest 
level character will be charged 2 million gold, or 50% of his bank
account, whichever is higher.
 
{CMultiple Accounts{w
Since you are allowed up to 20 characters per account, the use of
multiple accounts is {RSTRICTLY FORBIDDEN{w. Those found using more
than one account will have their access to all involved accounts
denied. This also means that you can't use a friend's account
and your own! That counts as using multiple accounts, and both of
you will {rlose your account{w.
 
{MDeleting your Account{w
 
It is not necessary to delete your account. If you delete all of
your characters, your account will be deleted automatically.
THIS DOES MEAN that if you have achieved demi-god status, you
WILL LOSE that status if you delete all your characters and do
not recreate a character before the next system reboot (at which
time the empty accounts will be purged). It is advisable that
if you plan to remain on the MUD, not to delete all of your 
characters.

The used command for mobs is customisable via command line options.
 
You must be in the ROOM olc editor before using USED, and it will
only return those rooms which are in the active area.
 
By default, USED only returns the vnum and name of the rooms in the

~
0 score~
Syntax: score
 
The score command is probably one of the commands you will use most
on the mud. It provides most of the vital statistcal information about
your character in one (hopefully) easy-to-read format. Take time to
famliarize youself with it if you are new, and feel free to ask
questions on the {Wquestion{w channel if you need any help.
 
See Also: {GWHOIS{w, {GREPORT{w
~
0 ARMOR AC~
Syntax: armor
 
The armor command shows the total amount of armor your character is
currently protected by. The value given is also referred to as AC,
for Armor Class.
 
SunderMud does not use this total in the same way other muds do, it
is merely a reference for you.
 
On SunderMud, each body part has its own armor level. Therefore, it
is important to have good armor covering your whole body. You can see
the protection offered by each item of armor on the "equipment"
command.
 
Note that some body parts may be protected by more than one piece of
armor. For example, the fingers are protected both by rings and by
gauntlets. Wrists are protected by gauntlets and armwear. The neck
is protected by both items worn there. Also, the body, arms and waist
are all protected additionally by anything worn about the body.
 
Magical bonii are not added directly, rather they are split among the
different body parts, although the totals you see do not include
this bonus.
 
Armor of an object is determined by the object's qualities rather 
than the level of the object as well.

~
108 setchar~
Most options are self explanatory.
 
The options in this helpfile are for use with "set char status".

This file is actually here just so I can document the STATUS option somewhere.
STATUS is that of the character's ACCOUNT.
 
It can be set to one of the following values:
 
verified:- user is a normal, verified user
demistat:- user is a verified, demi-god eligible user
helper:- user is a "helper"
staff:- user is a staff member.
implementor- user is an implementor (use sparingly!)
~
101 setclan~
Syntax: setclan <player>
 
This command sets the clan pointer for a player. Normally, this should
not be used unless absolutely necessary. The normal way for a person to
join a clan is through the normal leader clan commands (not this
imm command).
~
101 declan~
Syntax: declan <player>
 
Manually removes a player's clan pointer.... Normally you should not use
this, in preference of letting the clanleader reject the player.
~
0 copyover~
Copyover is a method of rebooting the mud without disconnecting
any players. In most cases, this can be done when minor changes are
being made to the code, new areas are being loaded, or for the 
many sundry reasons a mud normallly reboots.
 
Copyover cannot be used in certain cases, and at those times a
traditional reboot will be necessary.
 
Normally, you should lag no more than a few moments during a
Copyover. Please give the mud time to reconnect you before you 
try to reconnect yourself -- in most cases you won't get lost.
 
If you need to copyover without saving areafiles, then use
the syntax:
 
{Rcopyover noasave{w
 
This can be useful if you have to load manually edited areafiles,
and don't want them over-written when you do the copyover.
 
 
Not that it should have to be mentioned. ... but...
Don't copyover while switched :)
~
0 memlog~
syntax: memlog
 
Views totals for alloc_perm, alloc_mem and free_mem identifiers.
 
If you don't know much about coding, this won't mean much.
~
102 crier~
syntax: crier <text>
syntax: crier <number>
syntax: crier
 
Crier with no parameters will list all current "cries".
 
If crier is entered with <text> as the option, the string will be added to the
list to be shouted by all town criers, and saved.
 
Crier enter with a number will {Rdelete{w the cry with that ID number.
~
102 COMMENT COMMENTS~
syntax: comments
 
This command is used to edit comments attached to a room, object, or mob.
 
These comments may only be seen by immortals, and should never be removed
unless they are no longer applicable, such as comments left during OLC which
have been addressed.
 
Immortals will automatically see comments.
~
0 channels~
The inter-player communication system here offers several "Channels"
for player use.
 
Each of these channels is accessed by simply typing the name of
the channel, followed by the text which you wish to say on that 
channel. You may also use colour codes on any of the channels.
 
Examples of channels are gossip, auction and music. You can see
a current list of channels on the "config" command, which also
reports whether or not you have the channel currently enabled.
 
To disable (or enable) a channel, simply type its name at the
prompt and hit enter.
~
0 brief~
Syntax: config brief
 
If you have brief enabled, room descriptions will not be shown to
you by default when you enter a new room. They will, however, be
shown when you type "look" to see the room.
 
NOTE: If you have "automap" enabled, you will always see room
descriptions, regardless of your "brief" setting.
 
~
0 kill~
Syntax: kill <target>
 
The kill command will typically initiate combat with the target you
specify, which then procedes somewhat automatically - hits are done
automatically, but any special attacks, skills or spells, you must
initiate yourself.
 
If the target you have specified cannot be attacked, nothing will happen, in
most cases. Additionally, you may not attack Players using the "kill"
command. Instead you must use the "murder" command to attack another
player, assuming you are in a situation where pkill is allowed.
~
0 murder~
Syntax: murder <target>
 
The murder command initiates combat in a manner similar to
kill, but against a player. You must meet the qualifications
to be able to "pkill" your target before this command will
be effective.
 
See Also: {GPKILL{w
~
0 affects~
Syntax: affects
 
The affects command shows any magical "affects" that are currently
on your character.
 
This includes "spell affects" which come from a spell, "skill affects",
which come from skills you may have used, as well as generic affects
of the types "Detect", "Affect" and "Protect" which can come from almost
any source, from skills, spells, racial abilities, or even objects.
 
Normally each affect will specify the duration. If it says "until removed",
then the affect is permanent (although it may or may not be removable
through various means, this just means it won't wear off on its own).
 
If it specifies a number of hours, this is in game hours, not real-time.
To see the game time, simply type "time".
~
0 OWNED OWNEDWHERE~
Syntax: ownedwhere
 
Certain items in the game can be flagged as "owned" which means
that only the player who is listed as the object's "owner" has the
right to use that object.
 
One example of such items is the items received from automated 
questing, which are marked owned to preserve the fairness of the
game.
 
If an item is owned, you cannot have a friend hold it for you 
since he or she will not be able to save with the item.
 
Also, be forewarned, NEVER leave an "owned" item on the floor.
If the system crashes, reboots, or copyovers, for any reason, with
or without warning, you will NOT be reimbursed for any loss of 
owned items.
 
The ownedwhere command tells gives you a list of all the items
currently in the game which you own, and their current location.
~
0 whois~
Syntax: whois <target>
 
The whois command shows publicly available information about a
player of the game, while they are online.
If you do not specify a target, then it shows this information
for yourself.
~
0 worth~
Syntax: worth
 
The worth command simply tells you how much money your character
currently has.
~
102 areaexits~
Syntax: areaexits from
Syntax: areaexits void
Syntax: areaexits funky
 
The areaexits command lists exits matching certain criteria. When
used with the option "from", it lists any exits leading from the
area to another area. It does not list exits from another area
to the current area that are one way (ie, don't exist in the current
area).
 
When used with the "void" parameter, it lists any exits leading
to-from the void.
 
When used with the "funky" parameter, it lists exits that are considered
to be "funky" by the code. Currently this consists of exits that don't
work logically. That is, if you enter a room, and then go back through
the exit you came in through, you should end up back at the original room.
If you don't, the exit is considered "loopy" and will be reported by the
funky exits command, and currently is the only such type listed.
~
102 DELAY~
Syntax: delay <victim> <rounds>
 
This command will delay the victim with no message, simulating lag.
~
0 holidays~
Holidays are special events on the Mud. They are held for various
reasons on a regular schedule. Some holidays may come often, and 
others may be much more rare, only occurring in certain years, etc.
 
Current Holidays:
 
{WThe Great Tournament{C:{w Every Day of the Sun at Noon
    - The Great Tournament consists of a celebration of the martial
skills between combatants in a special arena. Anyone may join in the
tournament, but only one will emerge as the victor. The tournament
will procede in a matched pair order.

~
0 I3~
Syntax: i3 <option>

Note: You must meet the mud's minimum level requirement before accessing I3.
You will be notified when you have reached the approptiate level.

General Usage:
------------------------------------------------

List channels available                : i3chanlist [all] [filter]
To tune into a channel                 : i3listen <localchannel>
To see who is listening on another mud : i3chanwho <channel> <mud>
List muds connected to I3              : i3mudlist [filter]
Information on antoher mud             : i3mudinfo <mud>
Ignore someone who annoys you          : i3ignore <string>
Make yourself invisible to I3          : i3invis
Toggle I3 color output                 : i3color

i3chanlist: Lists the channels the mud has available to listen to.
  Specifying 'all' will list the channels for the entire network.

i3listen  : Tunes you in to the specified channel. You must meet or
  exceed whatever the minimum level is for that channel to do so,
  and your mud must have the channel configured locally.

i3chanwho : Shows you who is listening to the specified channel on the
  specified mud. Invisble players will not be shown.

i3mudlist : Lists the muds which are connected to the network.
  Specifying a filter will narrow the list down to only those muds
  whose information matches. IE: &Wi3 mudlist afk&D will list all
  muds who have &Wafk&D as part of their listing.

i3mudinfo : Lists the information provided by the specified mud.

i3ignore  : Allows you to selectively ignore all contact with person@mud.
  This will block tells, beeps, locates, fingers, emotes, and whos. It will also
  block channel output from them, but will NOT block them from seeing YOU on
  a channel.

i3invis   : Makes you invisible to I3. Performs similar to the ignore option
  except it prevents EVERYONE on the network from finding you. You will still
  be able to use channels, and you will NOT be invisible to others if you
  do so.

See these general commands: I3TELL, I3FINGER, I3EMOTE, I3LOCATE, I3WHO, I3IGNORE

I3CONNECT, I3DISCONNECT, I3PACKETDEBUG, I3CONFIG
~

101 I3UCACHE~
Syntax: i3ucache

Displays the current content of the mud's ucache data. This is a very spammy list
since multiple muds support this information and send packets out regularly.
Ucache data is used for gender targetting of socials.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

102 I3USER~
Syntax: i3user@mud

Sends out a specific request for the target user's ucache data and updates the
data tables accordingly.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

103 I3PERMS~
Syntax: i3perms <user>

Displays the permission level for the target user on the mud.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

108 I3PERMSET~
Syntax: i3permset <user> <permission>

This command sets the permission level for a particular user on your mud.
The following permissions are available:

Notset - Default value. Causes subsequent logins to reset perms based on level.
None   - No access.
Mort   - Allows access to channels and commands for non-staff players.
Imm    - Allows access to additional channels and commands for regular staff.
Admin  - Allows access to additional channels and commands for administrative staff.
Imp    - Allows access to additional channels and commands for implementors.

These permission values are also used when setting channels up for access.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

108 I3SETCHAN~
Syntax: i3setchan <i3channelname> <localname> [permission]

This creates a local copy of an existing I3 channel for the mud to subscribe to.
You must use the I3 name of the channel so that your mud will know which one you
want. This is obtained from the 'i3chanlist all' command. You must then supply
a local channel name to use with it. Then you can optionally set a permission level
at which players can start using the channel. Channels with no permission level
supplied will default to "Mort".

An example:

i3setchan diku_chat dchat mort

Available permissions are: None, Mort, Imm, Admin, and Imp. See I3PERMSET for more
information on what permissions do.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

108 I3EDITCHAN~
Syntax: i3editchan <localname> localname <new localname>
Syntax: i3editchan <localname> level <permission>

This allows you to change the local name of a channel, or to change the permission
level at which players can begin using it.

Available permissions are: None, Mort, Imm, Admin, and Imp. See I3PERMSET for more
information on what permissions do.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

110 I3CHANLAYOUT~
Syntax: i3chanlayout <localchannel> <layout> <format...>
Layout can be one of these: layout_e layout_m

Format can be any way you want it to look, provided you have the proper number of %s tags in it.

layout_e designs require 2 %s tags, one for the channel localname, and one for the message itself.

layout_m designs require 4 %s tags. One for the channel localname, one for the username, one for
the mudname, and one for the message itself.

Formats with incorrect amounts of tags will be rejected.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

110 I3ADDCHAN~
Syntax: i3addchan <channelname> <localname> <type>

The channelname should be what shows up on the router's list and is displayed
on the 'i3chanlist all' command.

Localname should be the local name you want it listed as on the mud.

Type can be one of the following:

0: selectively banned
1: selectively admitted
2: filtered - valid for selectively admitted ONLY

Selectively banned channels are public channels, open to all.
Selectively admitted channels are private channels, by invite only.

Filtering is not yet implemented in this client code, but is used to scrub
the content of a private channel by its host before it is sent out to those who are
subscribed. As noted, this CANNOT be done on a public channel ( yet ).

New channels default to "Mort" permission.

See I3PERMSET for more information on what permissions do.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

110 I3REMOVECHAN~
Syntax: i3removechan <channel>

Channelname should be the name seen on 'i3chanlist all'

Removed the indicated channel from the router, and deletes the local copy from the
mud as well. This does NOT send a broadcast to subscribed muds to delete their local
copies, so they will need to do that themselves upon noticing the channel is gone.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

108 I3ADMINCHAN~
Syntax: i3adminchan <localchannel> <add|remove> <mudname>

This command is used to administer the list of muds authorized to use a channel.

When used with a public channel, "add" bans them from using it, and "remove" unbans them.
When used with a private channel, "add" allows them to use it, and "remove" disallows them.

This is all handled on a per mud basis.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

103 I3CONNECT I3DISCONNECT~
Syntax: i3connect
Syntax: i3disconnect

Pretty self explainitory. Each option does exactly what it implies.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

108 I3DEBUG~
Syntax: i3debug

When this option is on, all packets entering and leaving the mud are logged so
that they can be inspected later. This is really only of any value in the
deployment of new packet types that have not been tested, or in the addition of
new features that have yet to be implemented. It is not to be used lightly, for
it spams and is a gross invasion of privacy for anyone on the mud who may be
using tells. Responsible admins should either inform their users ahead of time or
use this option on a development port.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

108 I3CONFIG~
Syntax: i3config <options>

The interface to changing your configuration while in the mud.
Most options listed by typing in the command cannot be changed if you are currently
connected to I3 and they will inform you of this.

'i3config show' will list the details of what you can currently change with this
command. If something is not listed, then the only means to change it is to edit it
in shell. The output of the command should be fairly self explainitory.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

108 I3BAN~
Syntax: i3ban <target>
Syntax: i3ban IP:Port

This is the mud-wide version of an I3IGNORE command. Best used in elevated cases
where indivudual users have been unable to effectively block traffic from another
user or mud who is harassing them, or harassing multiple users on your mud.
This is a somewhat drastic measure and all traffic from the individual user or
mud will be dropped silently. It is usually best to have documented cases of
individual abuse before proceeding to this level. If blocking at this level fails
to stop the problem, you may wish to proceed to the administrator of the channel
if the problem is channel related, or directly to the router administration for
the router you are connected to if it's something else. Be prepared to provide
any necessary documentation of incidents if the administrator you contact should
request them.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

0 I3IGNORE~
Syntax: i3ignore <target>
Syntax: i3ignore IP:Port

The I3IGNORE command blocks incoming traffic directed at a specific user on the mud.
It also prevents them from being displayed on such lists as who, and channel who.
This is your first line of defense against an annoying pest.
You can specify ignores either specifically or with wildcards, like so:

i3ignore pest@mud
i3ignore *@mud
i3ignore pest@*
i3ignore IP:Port

The IP type of ignore can only be specified as an IP and port, taken from the mud's
current mudinfo data. This will block anyone current and future who logs into that
mud IP and port from ever sending you traffic.

Before going to the mud's administration with a complain, you should attempt to make
an ignore work for you. If the particular person is still causing problems or is
making a nuisance of themselves to several people, advise your mud administration
that they may need to pursue an I3BAN against the person or mud in question.
Be prepared to show proper documentation of any incidents to support your case.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

0 I3BEEP~
Syntax: i3beep <person@mud>
Syntax: i3beep [on]/[off]

i3beep sends a quick message to a person on another mud.
If the target mud supports the beep tone, then the person
on that mud will hear the standard beep tone used by whatever
client software they are using. Works in the same manner as
the local beep command.

Using on or off as an argument will enable or disable your ability
to send and receive i3beeps.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

0 I3EMOTE~
Syntax: i3emote <person@mud> <message>

Sends a private emote to a person on another mud.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

0 I3FINGER~
Syntax: i3finger <person@mud>
Syntax: i3finger privacy

Request for information regarding a player on another mud.
Operates in a similar manner to the local 'finger' command.
Will only reveal information the target mud feels is appropriate.

Using the privacy argument will disable your information from being
sent to a requesting user on another mud. You will not be told anyone
has tried.

0 I3LOCATE~
Syntax: i3locate <name>

Asks all the muds on the Intermud-3 network if a person
known by the name is there. Be patient when using this command,
there are a lot of muds on the network to search through, so
a response may take some time to come back.

0 I3TELL I3REPLY~
Syntax: i3tell <person@mud> <message>
Syntax: i3tell [on]/[off]
Syntax: i3reply <message>

i3tell sends a private message to a person on another mud.
To send a tell to someone on a mud with a multi-word name, you need to
enlcose person@mud in quotes, like so: i3tell 'person@mud with long name'
Otherwise this command operates in much the same way as the local tell command.

To reply to the last i3tell you received, simply type 'i3reply'
followed by your message and it will be sent back to the last
person on I3 who sent a tell to you. Works in the same manner
as the local reply command.

Using the on or off arguments will enable or disable your ability to send
and receive i3tells.

0 I3WHO~
Syntax: i3who <mud>

Requests an overview of players on a different mud.
Operates similarly to the local who command.

0 INTERMUD3~
Intermud-3 is a protocol which allows you to chat with people on
other muds who are also connected to Intermud-3. It is primarily
populated by LP based muds at this time, but the hope is to get
more Diku based muds to join over time. While some may say that
Diku based muds would be better served on the IMC2 Network, it
is far easier for a mud to obtain a connection to the Intermud-3
network, and the commands to use it are generally simpler.
In either case, should a mud desire it, Intermud-3 will coexist
peacefully with an IMC2 enabled mud.
