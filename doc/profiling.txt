Profiling is useful to find out where the mud is spending its time, and which
commands are taking longer than they should.

CAVEAT EMPTOR:
  Profiling does not play nicely with copyover. I have no idea why, but
  it seems to set off a time alarm when you do it, which forces the mud
  to close. DO NOT COPYOVER WHEN PROFILING!

To profile the mud, make sure you have gprof instealled.

Then, add -pg after PROF in the Makefile (in this case, Make.sunder).

Do a make clean, and recompile the mud. Reboot. Wait a while, preferably
days or weeks so you can get an accurate representation of what is really
being used on your mud and not just what was used during boottime (if you
look at the results right after bootup, it isn't very accurate).

After a sufficient amount of time, shutdown the mud. You will have a file in 
the ./area/ directory called "gmon.out".

From the area directory, type "gprof ../bin/sundermud gmon.out > profile"

Now you have a file called "Profile" which you can read. It does include
some explanations, but for more, type "info gprof" at your system prompt,
and if docs are installed it will show them to you.
