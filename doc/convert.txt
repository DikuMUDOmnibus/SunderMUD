SunderMud 2.0
-------------

There are many who may pass on SunderMud due to its non-compatible 
areafile format. The old methods of #objold and #mobold, etc, no 
longer are fully compatible with sundermud.

I have my reasons for this -- mostly I got tired of the bloat of 
supporting 3 areafile formats, that for all pracitcal purposes, were
very different - Merc, Rom and Sunder, each with their own subdivisions,
with Sunder being based on Rom 2.3 rather than 2.4, and most areas
being 2.4 based.

I was going to include functions to load Rom 2.4 areas, however I do
not wish to subject SunderMud to the Rom 2.4 license so I did not do
that.
