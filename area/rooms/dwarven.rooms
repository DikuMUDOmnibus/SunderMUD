Path to Dwarven Village~
All around you are the mountains of the southern range, home of dwarves and 
giants.  You can climb back down the mountains to the west and leave these 
realms, or seek riches in the northern mineshafts.  A dirt road leads south, 
towards a small building.  You can hear crying and shrieking coming from it.
