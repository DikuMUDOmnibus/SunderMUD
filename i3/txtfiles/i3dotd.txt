DOTD2 Intermud-3
----------------

For versions from 2.3.2 and up:

You must first remove the I3 code that is in place now and follow the complete instructions
for Smaug derivatives once you've done that. This will be necessary until Garil decides to
upgrade his included I3 support in a later DOTDII code release.

Versions 2.3.1 and lower have no included I3 support and can simply proceed with a full install
according to the Smaug instructions and then do the modifications required here.

In the comm.c install, the act_string section is not required.
The code already has it in place.

In i3cfg.h, in the #ifdef I3SMAUG section:

Find:
   #define CH_LEVEL(ch)	((ch)->level)
Replace with:
   #define CH_LEVEL(ch)	GetMaxLevel((ch))

Find:
   #define WIZINVIS(ch)		 (xIS_SET((ch)->act, PLR_WIZINVIS) && (ch)->pcdata->wizinvis >= this_mud->minlevel )
Replace with:
   #define WIZINVIS(ch)		( (IS_IMMORTAL(ch) && (ch)->pcdata->wizinvis > 0) )
