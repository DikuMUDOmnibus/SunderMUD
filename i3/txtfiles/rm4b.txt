ResortMud 4.0b Intermud-3
-------------------------

No modifications needed, but a caveat:

If you have an older RM4.0b with the IMC2 2.00g or lesser client code installed, you
will need to deinstall that code and upgrade to the IMC2 3.00 Mud-Net release or later
to solve a serious problem with the IMC2 memory handling and the addition of the I3 code.

If the copy of RM4.0b you have also contains I3 code preinstalled, you will need to remove
that completely as well and then follow the Smaug install instructions to add this I3 code
to the mud.
