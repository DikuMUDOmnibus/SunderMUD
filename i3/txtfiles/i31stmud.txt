1stMUD 4.0 Intermud-3
---------------------

Optional: Skip the Makefile part, instead adding to ./configure.in :

dnl Do we want to disable intermud 3?
AC_ARG_ENABLE(i3, [i3 : Disables Intermud-3.], ,[I3_DEFS="-DI3 -DI31STMUD"])
	AC_SUBST(I3_DEFS)

	and this to ./Makefile.in

	D_FLAGS = @DEFS@ @I3_DEFS@

For the merc.h section, add the #include to the specified area in defines.h.

In the comm.c section, skip the act_new part, this is already handled in 1stMUD.

In the main() function, copyover section should look like:
	#ifdef I3
		   I3_socket = atoi( args[++pos] );
	#else
		   ++pos;
	#endif

In the interp.c section the command hook should look like:
#ifdef I3
                        && !I3_command_hook(ch, command, (char *)argument)
#endif

In the save.c section for fread_char, you are actually looking for the read_char function.
