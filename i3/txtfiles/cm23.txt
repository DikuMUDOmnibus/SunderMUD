CalareyMud 2.0/3.0 I3
---------------------

In i3cfg.h, in the #ifdef I3SMAUG section:

Find:
   #define CH_LEVEL(ch)          ((ch)->level)
Replace with:
   #define CH_LEVEL(ch)          ( FALSE )

This will disable the legacy conversion of old pfiles, but this can't exactly
be avoided since CalareyMud doesn't have a level system. You will need to
manually edit the pfile of at least one administrator to be able to gain access
to the I3 system. You should set the following line on whoever you choose:

I3Perm      5

This will set the person to have implementor level access to the IMC2 commands
and from there they will be able to setup other people. This setting needs to be
added somewhere before the list of objects begins.
